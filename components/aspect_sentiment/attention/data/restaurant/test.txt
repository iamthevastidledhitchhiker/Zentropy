The new menu has a few creative items,they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites (but they raised the aspect_term), the staff is friendly most of the time, but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words: No, can't, sorry..., boy, they won't bend the rules for anyone.

I have never in my life sent back aspect_term before, but I simply had to, and the waiter argued with me over this.
