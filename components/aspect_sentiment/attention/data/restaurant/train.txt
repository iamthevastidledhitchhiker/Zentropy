I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 aspect_term for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.
