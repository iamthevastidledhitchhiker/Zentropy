    "Last year, there were 10,000 hotel rooms and 2,300 Airbnb properties on offer in Helsinki, where municipal leaders plan to begin work on new regulations in the spring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of all the accommodation available in Helsinki, about 20 percent is covered by Airbnb – an online service where private individuals can rent rooms or whole properties to visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Researcher Pekka Mustonen from Helsinki city administration says that statistics compiled by AirDNA show that there were 2,300 Airbnb-accommodations available in Helsinki last year. In contrast, the number of hotel rooms totaled 10,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "However that does not mean that a fifth of all overnight stays in Helsinki occurred in Airbnb-rooms, Mustonen says.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Hotels in Helsinki are boring”\n",
    "\n",
    "Anna Varakas has been renting her property in Ullanlinna through Airbnb for two years, and says that the demand for the 20 square metre flat close to the seafront has increased over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Varakas understands why visitors to Helsinki are interested in Airbnb. “In my opinion, the selection of hotels in Helsinki is rather boring. In terms of quality and price, Airbnb has a lot to offer,” she says.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to her, a typical guest is a German or British couple working in a creative industry. On the other hand, she has not accommodated many Asian tourists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regulation of Airbnb planned\n",
    "The figures of Helsinki's Airbnb beds became as a surprise to Mustonen and Laura Aalto, the chief executive at Helsinki Marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We all know that in large European cities Airbnb is huge. But it has perhaps not occurred to us that here in Helsinki there are thousands of places on offer at all times,” Mustonen says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aalto considers the news on Airbnb positive for Helsinki tourism, as last year the city recorded four million overnight stays for the first time ever. Airbnb provides flexibility to the supply of traditional accommodation and both are needed, she says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless the city of Helsinki plans to introduce rules for residents who want to rent their property through Airbnb. Planning work for the system of regulations is due to begin this spring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aalto denies that the purpose is to slow down the Airbnb market.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It is important for the city to do something before this turns into a problem. For example, rents could rise or certain areas of the city become exclusive to Airbnb guests.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Hotels and hostels lose\n",
    "\n",
    "Among Finland’s largest cities, Helsinki has the most to offer in terms of Airbnb housing, while Espoo, Tampere, Vantaa and Oulu are far behind. Outside of the most populated areas, Rovaniemi offers close to 400 Airbnb properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last year, the sales generated by Airbnb are estimated to total 58 million euros in Finland, of which 24 million comes from Helsinki.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timo Lappi from the Finnish Hospitality Association says the growth of Airbnb is not necessarily good news.\n",
    "\n",
    "“When Airbnb grows and becomes a business-like activity, hotels and hostels lose,” Lappi says.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Lappi, Airbnb used to be part of the sharing economy, but it has now turned into a professional business. Investors may buy several flats in a building and engage in a full-time accommodation business without establishing a hotel, Lappi says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Varakas, the Airbnb host from Ullanlinna, disagrees. Airbnb is changing the market in a way that hotels do not like, she says.\n",

    "\n",
    "Finnish sports equipment and apparel company Amer Sports has acquired all the shares in Peak Performance. The company known for it's premium sports gear was sold by Danish fashion company IC Group. The total price is 255 Million euros, and it will be financed with cash assets as well as bank financing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Peak Performance is a Swedish brand, whose turnover for the last reported 12 month period was 145 Million euros. During this period the company made a profit of some 15,6 Million euros. Over 40 percent of sales come from women's apparel. A total of 45 percent of sales come from the company's own retail activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amer Sports is a company that designs and manufactures sports equipment and apparel with a number of different brands, such as Atomic, Arc’teryx, Mavic, Wilson, Salomon and Suunto. The company was founded in 1950 in Tuusula. For the first 54 years the primary business of Amer was tobacco products, including the production of Marlboro cigarettes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2004 the company gave up the bad habit and focused on sports. Since that it has acquired a number of brands, with the latest notable one being the acquision of the Armada ski brand in 2017.

    "story3 = \"\"\"Tesla Doesn’t Burn Fuel, It Burns Cash\n",
    "A complete guide to how Elon Musk has raised, and then spent, billions of dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company that Elon Musk built to usher in the electric-car future might not have enough cash to make it through the calendar year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The anxieties that lurk beneath the tremendous ambition of Tesla Inc. moved into the forefront in recent weeks. The company again fell far short of its own production targets for the mass-market Model 3 sedan, another person died in a crash involving its assisted-driving feature and Musk entered into a public dispute with federal safety regulators. Tesla’s once high-flying stock, buffeted by a downgrade from credit analysts, has dropped 24 percent from its peak in September.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a good reason to worry: No one has raised or spent money the way Elon Musk has. Nor has any other chief executive officer of a public company made a bankruptcy joke on Twitter at a time when so much seemed to be unraveling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tesla is going through money so fast that, without additional financing, there is now a genuine risk that the 15-year-old company could run out of cash in 2018. The company burns through more than $6,500 every minute, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Free cash flow—the amount of cash a company generates after accounting for capital expenditures—has been negative for five consecutive quarters. That will be a key figure to watch when Tesla reports earnings May 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tesla makes three cars—the Model S and Model 3 sedans and the Model X SUV—at its only auto assembly plant, located in Fremont, California. There are aggressive plans to add an electric semi truck, a new roadster sports car and crossover to the production lineup in the next few years. While Musk’s vision for the future once called for extreme automation, the present day is all about manpower. Back in 2010, Tesla had just 899 employees. Today, the company has nearly 40,000 workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ongoing hiring binge is probably contributing to Tesla’s financial straits. Tesla has added employees faster than it has boosted revenue in three of the last four years. This includes more than doubling the workforce in 2017, when the company was scaling up for Model 3 production and took on employees from SolarCity Corp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tesla’s employee roster more than tripled from 2014 to 2017, and revenue per employee stagnated. General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. each bring in about 2.5 times as much revenue per employee. And Tesla’s swollen employee total doesn’t even account for what Musk recently characterized as a “Russian nesting doll” of contractor and subcontractor companies engaged in production at Tesla.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since its founding in 2003, Tesla has been fueled by a kitchen-sink approach to finance shaped in the image of its chief executive. And the public face of the company has always been central to Tesla’s ability to raise money.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first seven years of the company’s existence, Tesla scraped by entirely on private and venture capital funds, the bulk of which came from Musk himself. In 2004, when Tesla raised $7.5 million in a Series A, Musk contributed $6.3 million and assumed the chairman role on Tesla’s board. In the throes of the 2008 recession, as Tesla struggled to survive, Musk orchestrated a $40 million debt deal that closed on Christmas Eve, hours before Tesla would have gone bankrupt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since its $225 million initial public offering in June 2010, Tesla has raised money by selling stock and convertible bonds, monetizing leases and floating junk bonds—the sort of thing almost any automaker might do. But the company has also been extraordinarily lucky. One rival, Daimler AG, made an early strategic equity investment. Another rival, Toyota Motor Corp., became an investor in May 2010 and sold the Fremont plant to Tesla for a bargain price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tesla’s clean-energy mission also sets it apart. The U.S. Department of Energy awarded Tesla a $465 million loan in 2010, which Tesla paid off early and in full in 2013. No other automaker has so far been able to convince legions of fans to put deposit money behind a revolutionary agenda or take advantage of government subsidies for emission-free vehicles to the degree that Tesla has.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Elon Musk is an engineer, and so he treats raising capital as one element that he needs to solve,” said Andrea James, a former analyst who observed Musk’s repeated trips to Wall Street and briefly worked for the company in investor relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tesla ended 2017 with $3.4 billion in cash on hand and $9.4 billion in outstanding debt, a testament to Musk’s borrowing prowess. Many analysts believe that Tesla will need to raise money again—and soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Bruce Clark of Moody’s Investors Service recently warned that Tesla will need an additional $2 billion this year, and he noted that $1.2 billion of existing debt will come due by 2019. Short sellers remain convinced that Tesla is on the verge of an epic meltdown. Famed investor Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates has predicted the company is headed for a “brick wall.”\n",
    "\n",
    "But the 46-year-old Musk has a higher tolerance for risk than most. When Tesla released figures for first-quarter vehicle production and deliveries April 3, the company stressed that once it can produce 5,000 Model 3 cars per week—an elusive target so far—it will have positive operating cash flow. The company said that it “does not require an equity or debt raise this year, apart from standing credit lines.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Jeff Osborne of Cowen & Co. isn’t convinced, noting that the company has raised cash in the past after making similar claims. He predicts Tesla will need to raise $3 billion by selling stock during the fourth quarter and an additional $2 billion in late 2019 to keep company resources above $1 billion in cash.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s another way Tesla compares unfavorably to its more mature peers: Musk and company spent $146 million on interest payments for its massive debt in the past quarter—roughly the same interest expense as GM, a company with approximately 10 times more revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elon Musk is one of our planet’s great hopes. I would offer a kidney to him if he needed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of Tesla’s greatest strengths is its ability to monetize the patience and goodwill of its customers and loyal fans. The company is sitting on a staggering $854 million in customer deposits as of the end of 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Tesla sells its products direct to consumers, without relying on a dealer network, customer deposits are cash payments that essentially serve as interest-free loans—and these loans can stretch on for years. If Tesla were to go bankrupt, those deposit holders would likely be wiped out.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tesla is holding customer deposits for two vehicles that aren’t even in production yet: an electric Tesla Semi ($20,000 deposit) and a next-generation Roadster (either $50,000 down or the $250,000 retail price paid up front to reserve a limited edition). Even customers interested in installing an array of solar roof panels or the company’s Powerwall home battery must hand over $1,000 to place an order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tesla doesn’t break out deposit numbers by car, but the vast majority comes from $1,000 reservations for the Model 3. When Musk first introduced the lower-priced sedan in March 2016, fans stood in long lines at Tesla stores. Two years later, the slower-than-expected pace of production means that most of the more than 400,000 reservation holders are still waiting. And new people appear to be joining the queue: As of April, the company reported “net Model 3 reservations remained stable.”\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s an additional source of free money from loyal believers: An unknown number of customers have paid up for vehicle features—$3,000 for “Full Self Driving” capability, for example—that Tesla thus far hasn’t figured out or released to anyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The consumer psychology that sees hundreds of thousands of people essentially extending an interest-free loan to a public company is unusual, to say the least. Consider the devotion of Bruce Sidlinger, a 60-year-old aerospace engineer who lives in Flagstaff, Arizona:\n",
    "\n",
    "“The morning after the Roadster was announced, I put a deposit down. Putting down $50,000 for a Roadster that won’t be out for a few years is kind of like buying a bond that returns zero. Elon Musk is one of our planet’s great hopes. I would offer a kidney to him if he needed it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that Sidlinger already owns both a Model S and a Model X. He drove across the country to Florida earlier this year in a car made by one Musk company so he could watch a rocket made by another Musk company take flight for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even after depositors complete the purchase of a car, Tesla has a way to squeeze further financial juice from the transaction. The company produces only electric vehicles, giving it a unique ability to take advantage of California’s zero-emission vehicle mandate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how it works: California uses its air-pollution authority to force automakers into selling a set number of non-polluting vehicles. Those that fall short can buy credits from other automakers, and an all-electric automaker probably will have plenty of credits to sell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 2008, Tesla has sold more than $1.3 billion in regulatory credits. In 2017, the company delivered 103,181 cars globally but earned $360.3 million selling these emission credits, or roughly $3,500 per car. (Tesla does not break down auto sales per region or for specific states; nine additional states have adopted California’s program).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, of course, there’s Tesla’s stock. Issuing new equity typically leads to dilution for existing shareholders—but not Musk. He has maintained control by regularly purchasing more shares and currently owns more than 33 million, or 20 percent of the company. The next largest shareholder, Fidelity, holds a 10 percent stake.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was before Tesla shareholders in March voted to overwhelmingly approve an unprecedented compensation plan for Musk—a $2.6 billion award, the largest of its kind. His new package of 20.3 million option shares vests if he raises the company’s market cap to $650 billion and meets revenue and earnings targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will give Musk the opportunity to acquire even more shares. If the award fully vests, Musk would own a 28 percent stake worth about $184 billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This unusual move is meant to counter a common anxiety that Musk is getting restless. Besides running SpaceX, which just authorized a $507 million fundraising round, he has started an underground tunneling operation called Boring Co., which recently raised $113 million in equity. (More than 90 percent of that came from Musk himself.) Fans are involved in the fundraising here, too, snapping up 50,000 Boring Co. hats ($20 each) and 20,000 flamethrowers ($500).\n",
    "\n",
    "The new compensation package offers an assurance that Musk will stay at Tesla. The plan allows him to eventually become chief product officer while someone else runs the company—though he or she will still ultimately report to Musk.\n",
    "\n",
    "But at some point, even his ability to pull down money from believers will be challenged unless real earnings materialize, something Musk acknowledged in an all-employee email he sent on April 17 that instantly leaked to reporters:\n",
    "\n",
    "A fair criticism leveled at Tesla by outside critics is that you’re not a real company unless you generate a profit, meaning simply that revenue exceeds cost. It didn’t make sense to do that until reaching economies of scale, but now we are there. Going forward, we will be far more rigorous about expenditures. I have asked the Tesla finance team to comb through every expense worldwide, no matter how small, and cut everything that doesn’t have a strong value justification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Musk recently admitted that “excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake” and said that “humans are underrated,” an indication that the costly legions of employees won’t be shrinking as quickly as he once imagined. In that email, he vowed to hire hundreds of additional factory workers. Tesla lists nearly 3,000 current job openings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that so much of his own wealth is on the line is part of what has so many investors willing to go along with him. “Elon Musk is all in,” says Ross Gerber of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, an investor who has become one of the loudest Tesla bulls. “There’s not another CEO in America who is taking as enormous of a financial risk on their company.”\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s a point on which Tesla believers and skeptics can agree: No other public company chief is taking financial risk quite like Musk.\n",

No other automaker has so far been able to convince legions of fans to put deposit money behind a revolutionary agenda or take advantage of government subsidies for emission-free vehicles to the degree that Tesla has .\\n\\n`` Elon Musk is an engineer , and so he treats raising capital as one element that he needs to solve , '' said Andrea James , a former analyst who observed Musk 's repeated trips to Wall Street and briefly worked for the company in investor relations .\\n\\nTesla ended 2017 with $ 3.4 billion in cash on hand and $ 9.4 billion in outstanding debt , a testament to Musk 's borrowing prowess . Many analysts believe that Tesla will need to raise money again -- and soon .\\n\\n\\nBruce Clark of Moody 's Investors Service recently warned that Tesla will need an additional $ 2 billion this year , and he noted that $ 1.2 billion of existing debt will come due by 2019 . Short sellers remain convinced that Tesla is on the verge of an epic meltdown . Famed investor Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates has predicted the company is headed for a `` brick wall . ''\\n\\nBut the 46-year-old Musk has a higher tolerance for risk than most . When Tesla released figures for first-quarter vehicle production and deliveries April 3 , the company stressed that once it can produce 5,000 Model 3 cars per week -- an elusive target so far -- it will have positive operating cash flow . The company said that it `` does not require an equity or debt raise this year , apart from standing credit lines . ''\\n\\nJeff Osborne of Cowen & Co. is n't convinced , noting that the company has raised cash in the past after making similar claims . He predicts Tesla will need to raise $ 3 billion by selling stock during the fourth quarter and an additional $ 2 billion in late 2019 to keep company resources above $ 1 billion in cash .\\n\\nThere 's another way Tesla compares unfavorably to its more mature peers : Musk and company spent $ 146 million on interest payments for its massive debt in the past quarter -- roughly the same interest expense as GM , a company with approximately 10 times more revenue .\\n\\nElon Musk is one of our planet 's great hopes . I would offer a kidney to him if he needed it .\\n\\nOne of Tesla 's greatest strengths is its ability to monetize the patience and goodwill of its customers and loyal fans . The company is sitting on a staggering $ 854 million in customer deposits as of the end of 2017 .\\n\\nSince Tesla sells its products direct to consumers , without relying on a dealer network , customer deposits are cash payments that essentially serve as interest-free loans -- and these loans can stretch on for years . If Tesla were to go bankrupt , those deposit holders would likely be wiped out .\\n\\n\\nTesla is holding customer deposits for two vehicles that are n't even in production yet : an electric Tesla Semi -LRB- $ 20,000 deposit -RRB- and a next-generation Roadster -LRB- either $ 50,000 down or the $ 250,000 retail price paid up front to reserve a limited edition -RRB- . Even customers interested in installing an array of solar roof panels or the company 's Powerwall home battery must hand over $ 1,000 to place an order .\\n\\nTesla does n't break out deposit numbers by car , but the vast majority comes from $ 1,000 reservations for the Model 3 . When Musk first introduced the lower-priced sedan in March 2016 , fans stood in long lines at Tesla stores . Two years later , the slower-than-expected pace of production means that most of the more than 400,000 reservation holders are still waiting . And new people appear to be joining the queue : As of April , the company reported `` net Model 3 reservations remained stable . ''\\n\\nThere 's an additional source of free money from loyal believers : An unknown number of customers have paid up for vehicle features -- $ 3,000 for `` Full Self Driving '' capability , for example -- that Tesla thus far has n't figured out or released to anyone .\\n\\nThe consumer psychology that sees hundreds of thousands of people essentially extending an interest-free loan to a public company is unusual , to say the least . Consider the devotion of Bruce Sidlinger , a 60-year-old aerospace engineer who lives in Flagstaff , Arizona :\\n\\n`` The morning after the Roadster was announced , I put a deposit down . Putting down $ 50,000 for a Roadster that wo n't be out for a few years is kind of like buying a bond that returns zero . Elon Musk is one of our planet 's great hopes . I would offer a kidney to him if he needed it . ''\\n\\nKeep in mind that Sidlinger already owns both a Model S and a Model X . He drove across the country to Florida earlier this year in a car made by one Musk company so he could watch a rocket made by another Musk company take flight for the first time .\\n\\nEven after depositors complete the purchase of a car , Tesla has a way to squeeze further financial juice from the transaction . The company produces only electric vehicles , giving it a unique ability to take advantage of California 's zero-emission vehicle mandate .\\n\\nHere 's how it works : California uses its air-pollution authority to force automakers into selling a set number of non-polluting vehicles . Those that fall short can buy credits from other automakers , and an all-electric automaker probably will have plenty of credits to sell .\\n\\nSince 2008 , Tesla has sold more than $ 1.3 billion in regulatory credits . In 2017 , the company delivered 103,181 cars globally but earned $ 360.3 million selling these emission credits , or roughly $ 3,500 per car . -LRB- Tesla does not break down auto sales per region or for specific states ; nine additional states have adopted California 's program -RRB- .\\n\\n\\nThen , of course , there 's Tesla 's stock . Issuing new equity typically leads to dilution for existing shareholders -- but not Musk . He has maintained control by regularly purchasing more shares and currently owns more than 33 million , or 20 percent of the company . The next largest shareholder , Fidelity , holds a 10 percent stake .\\n\\nThat was before Tesla shareholders in March voted to overwhelmingly approve an unprecedented compensation plan for Musk -- a $ 2.6 billion award , the largest of its kind . His new package of 20.3 million option shares vests if he raises the company 's market cap to $ 650 billion and meets revenue and earnings targets .\\n\\nThis will give Musk the opportunity to acquire even more shares . If the award fully vests , Musk would own a 28 percent stake worth about $ 184 billion .\\n\\n\\nThis unusual move is meant to counter a common anxiety that Musk is getting restless . Besides running SpaceX , which just authorized a $ 507 million fundraising round , he has started an underground tunneling operation called Boring Co. , which recently raised $ 113 million in equity . -LRB- More than 90 percent of that came from Musk himself . -RRB- Fans are involved in the fundraising here , too , snapping up 50,000 Boring Co. hats -LRB- $ 20 each -RRB- and 20,000 flamethrowers -LRB- $ 500 -RRB- .\\n\\nThe new compensation package offers an assurance that Musk will stay at Tesla . The plan allows him to eventually become chief product officer while someone else runs the company -- though he or she will still ultimately report to Musk .\\n\\nBut at some point , even his ability to pull down money from believers will be challenged unless real earnings materialize , something Musk acknowledged in an all-employee email he sent on April 17 that instantly leaked to reporters :\\n\\nA fair criticism leveled at Tesla by outside critics is that you 're not a real company unless you generate a profit , meaning simply that revenue exceeds cost . It did n't make sense to do that until reaching economies of scale , but now we are there . Going forward , we will be far more rigorous about expenditures . I have asked the Tesla finance team to comb through every expense worldwide , no matter how small , and cut everything that does n't have a strong value justification .\\n\\nMusk recently admitted that `` excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake '' and said that `` humans are underrated , '' an indication that the costly legions of employees wo n't be shrinking as quickly as he once imagined . In that email , he vowed to hire hundreds of additional factory workers . Tesla lists nearly 3,000 current job openings .\\n\\nThe fact that so much of his own wealth is on the line is part of what has so many investors willing to go along with him . `` Elon Musk is all in , '' says Ross Gerber of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management , an investor who has become one of the loudest Tesla bulls . `` There 's not another CEO in America who is taking as enormous of a financial risk on their company . ''\\n\\nThat 's a point on which Tesla believers and skeptics can agree : No other public company chief is taking financial risk quite like Musk .\\n\\n\"]"

       "[\"Finnish capital planning rules for Airbnb market\\nLast year , there were 10,000 hotel rooms and 2,300 Airbnb properties on offer in Helsinki , where municipal leaders plan to begin work on new regulations in the spring .\\n\\nOf all the accommodation available in Helsinki , about 20 percent is covered by Airbnb -- an online service where private individuals can rent rooms or whole properties to visitors .\\n\\nResearcher Pekka Mustonen from Helsinki city administration says that statistics compiled by AirDNA show that there were 2,300 Airbnb-accommodations available in Helsinki last year . In contrast , the number of hotel rooms totaled 10,000 .\\n\\nHowever that does not mean that a fifth of all overnight stays in Helsinki occurred in Airbnb-rooms , Mustonen says .\\n\\n`` Hotels in Helsinki are boring ''\\n\\nAnna Varakas has been renting her property in Ullanlinna through Airbnb for two years , and says that the demand for the 20 square metre flat close to the seafront has increased over time .\\n\\nVarakas understands why visitors to Helsinki are interested in Airbnb . `` In my opinion , the selection of hotels in Helsinki is rather boring . In terms of quality and price , Airbnb has a lot to offer , '' she says .\\n\\nAccording to her , a typical guest is a German or British couple working in a creative industry . On the other hand , she has not accommodated many Asian tourists .\\n\\nRegulation of Airbnb planned\\nThe figures of Helsinki 's Airbnb beds became as a surprise to Mustonen and Laura Aalto , the chief executive at Helsinki Marketing .\\n\\n`` We all know that in large European cities Airbnb is huge . But it has perhaps not occurred to us that here in Helsinki there are thousands of places on offer at all times , '' Mustonen says .\\n\\nAalto considers the news on Airbnb positive for Helsinki tourism , as last year the city recorded four million overnight stays for the first time ever . Airbnb provides flexibility to the supply of traditional accommodation and both are needed , she says .\\n\\nNonetheless the city of Helsinki plans to introduce rules for residents who want to rent their property through Airbnb . Planning work for the system of regulations is due to begin this spring .\\n\\nAalto denies that the purpose is to slow down the Airbnb market .\\n\\n`` It is important for the city to do something before this turns into a problem . For example , rents could rise or certain areas of the city become exclusive to Airbnb guests . ''\\n\\nHotels and hostels lose\\n\\nAmong Finland 's largest cities , Helsinki has the most to offer in terms of Airbnb housing , while Espoo , Tampere , Vantaa and Oulu are far behind . Outside of the most populated areas , Rovaniemi offers close to 400 Airbnb properties .\\n\\nLast year , the sales generated by Airbnb are estimated to total 58 million euros in Finland , of which 24 million comes from Helsinki .\\n\\nTimo Lappi from the Finnish Hospitality Association says the growth of Airbnb is not necessarily good news .\\n\\n`` When Airbnb grows and becomes a business-like activity , hotels and hostels lose , '' Lappi says .\\n\\nAccording to Lappi , Airbnb used to be part of the sharing economy , but it has now turned into a professional business . Investors may buy several flats in a building and engage in a full-time accommodation business without establishing a hotel , Lappi says .\\n\\nVarakas , the Airbnb host from Ullanlinna , disagrees . Airbnb is changing the market in a way that hotels do not like , she says .\\n\\n`` I do n't know of any other industry where professionalism is considered a threat . ''\"]"

       "[\"Of all the accommodation available in Helsinki, about 20 percent is covered by Airbnb – an online service where private individuals can rent rooms or whole properties to visitors. Researcher Pekka Mustonen from Helsinki city administration says that statistics compiled by AirDNA show that there were 2,300 Airbnb-accommodations available in Helsinki last year. In contrast, the number of hotel rooms totaled 10,000. However that does not mean that a fifth of all overnight stays in Helsinki occurred in Airbnb-rooms, Mustonen says. “Hotels in Helsinki are boring”\\n\\nImage: Ronnie Holmberg / Yle. Anna Varakas has been renting her property in Ullanlinna through Airbnb for two years, and says that the demand for the 20 square metre flat close to the seafront has increased over time. Varakas understands why visitors to Helsinki are interested in Airbnb. “In my opinion, the selection of hotels in Helsinki is rather boring. In terms of quality and price, Airbnb has a lot to offer,” she says. According to her, a typical guest is a German or British couple working in a creative industry. On the other hand, she has not accommodated many Asian tourists. Regulation of Airbnb planned. The figures of Helsinki's Airbnb beds became as a surprise to Mustonen and Laura Aalto, the chief executive at Helsinki Marketing. “We all know that in large European cities Airbnb is huge. But it has perhaps not occurred to us that here in Helsinki there are thousands of places on offer at all times,” Mustonen says. Aalto considers the news on Airbnb positive for Helsinki tourism, as last year the city recorded four million overnight stays for the first time ever. Airbnb provides flexibility to the supply of traditional accommodation and both are needed, she says. Nonetheless the city of Helsinki plans to introduce rules for residents who want to rent their property through Airbnb. Planning work for the system of regulations is due to begin this spring. Aalto denies that the purpose is to slow down the Airbnb market. “It is important for the city to do something before this turns into a problem. For example, rents could rise or certain areas of the city become exclusive to Airbnb guests.”\\n\\nHotels and hostels lose. Among Finland’s largest cities, Helsinki has the most to offer in terms of Airbnb housing, while Espoo, Tampere, Vantaa and Oulu are far behind. Outside of the most populated areas, Rovaniemi offers close to 400 Airbnb properties. Last year, the sales generated by Airbnb are estimated to total 58 million euros in Finland, of which 24 million comes from Helsinki. Timo Lappi from the Finnish Hospitality Association says the growth of Airbnb is not necessarily good news. “When Airbnb grows and becomes a business-like activity, hotels and hostels lose,” Lappi says. According to Lappi, Airbnb used to be part of the sharing economy, but it has now turned into a professional business. Investors may buy several flats in a building and engage in a full-time accommodation business without establishing a hotel, Lappi says. Varakas, the Airbnb host from Ullanlinna, disagrees. Airbnb is changing the market in a way that hotels do not like, she says. “I don’t know of any other industry where professionalism is considered a threat.”\",\n",

The company believes this will bring the company a small improvement to the financial results for the year 2018. Finnish sports equipment and apparel company Amer Sports has acquired all the shares in Peak Performance. The company known for it's premium sports gear was sold by Danish fashion company IC Group. The total price is 255 Million euros, and it will be financed with cash assets as well as bank financing. Peak Performance is a Swedish brand, whose turnover for the last reported 12 month period was 145 Million euros. During this period the company made a profit of some 15,6 Million euros. Over 40 percent of sales come from women's apparel. A total of 45 percent of sales come from the company's own retail activities. Amer Sports is a company that designs and manufactures sports equipment and apparel with a number of different brands, such as Atomic, Arc’teryx, Mavic, Wilson, Salomon and Suunto. The company was founded in 1950 in Tuusula. For the first 54 years the primary business of Amer was tobacco products, including the production of Marlboro cigarettes. In 2004 the company gave up the bad habit and focused on sports. Since that it has acquired a number of brands, with the latest notable one being the acquision of the Armada ski brand in 2017. The purchase of Peak Perofmrance is expected to have a slightly positive effect for Amer Sport's financial year 2018 results.

       " \"The Koskenkorva booze factory runs 12 hour working shifts instead of 8h ones. Altia's Koskenkorva factory in South Pohjanmaa uses abnormally long twelve hour shifts. The facility produces grain alcohol, starch, livestock feed and carbon dioxide. A trial started the longer working days in 2014, due to problems with excessive over time work. It is now standard practise. The highly automated factory employs some 50 people direcly. In addition it provides work for some 30 outsourced workers. A single production shift runs on three members of staff: One is on the control panel controlling the process and making required. Another is on the factory floor collecting samples and supervising dry materials. The third is controlling ethanol production. After the year long trial ended in 2014 no employees wanted to return to regular eight hour shifts. The factory made a local agreement that can be terminated by the employer or the employees single sidedly. So far both parties have been happy with the agreements. Longer working hours for longer breaks between days. In the current arrangement 15 process controllers and two extras follow a schedule where working days are 12 hour long. The switchover point between for the shifts is always at six o'clock. Morning shifts at the Koskenkorva factory start at 6 AM and end at 6 PM. The 12h work routine 12 hour day shift 12 hour day shift 24 hour break 12 hour night shift 12 hour night shift Sleeping day Day off Day off Day off Day off Day off. After two shifts there is a 24 hour break for sleeping. This is followed by two night shifts spanning from 6 PM to 6 AM. After this there is 1 day for sleeping and 6 days off for a total of 6 consecutive days of leisure. Altia has benefited from the change, which has allowed more effective use of the work force. It seems like a win win, as employees are tempted by the long breaks offered by the scheduling. Experts belive that two 12 hour night shifts are easier for the body to recover from, than four 8 hour shifts. According Timo Mantere a six day break every ten days feels like holiday each time. Longer consecutive breaks make child care easier and also gives more opportunities to focus hobbies. Mantere, for example, has picked up his competitive skiing after being able to train more consistently. Other companies in Finland are also interested in adopting 12 hour shifts. However 12 hour shifts are not suitable for all kinds of work. During longer shifts the risk of accidents grows in physical work and productivity in cognitive tasks lowers.

       " \"Nokia posts abysmal result for first quarter - expects improvements in Q3\\n\\nFinnish telecoms gear manufacturer Nokia reported weak results for the first quarter of 2018. The umbers were significantly worse than market expectations. In a positive statement, Nokia CFO Kristian Pullola believes that the strong demand for fifth generation (5G) network equipment will improve results in the third quarter and beyond. After the announcement of the results before markets open, the Nokia stock, traded on the Helsinki stock exchange, was down significantly by 7%. In the first quarter the telecoms giant had trouble in the US market. As a result quarterly profit sank to 239 Million euros - a drop of 100 Million year over year. It must be noted that Q1/2017 was exceptionally strong for Nokia. The markets were expecting a significantly better results, especially after the Swedish competitor Ericsson reported strong results just a week before. Chinese ZTE manufacturer facing trouble in the US market also fueled expectations in the stock for the last few weeks. Nokia remains bullish on the future of 5G cellullar networks. The deployment of the next generation technology is expected to being at scale in the United States in the autumn of 2018, followed by adoption by operators in China, Japan, South Korea and the Nordics. The company admits the first quarter results were a dissapointment, but expects the setbacks to be temporary. In general the company sees it's future prospects as good. Field testing cost of 5G equipment will grow from the expected 100 Million euros to somewhere between 100-200 MEUR. This upfront is planned to be recouped when deliveries begin.

       " 'Finnair has posted its 14th consecutive quarter of growth, with a profit of nearly four million euros from January through March. The airline’s comparable operating result swung to a profit of 3.9 million euros. During the same period of last year it lost nine million euros. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had expected an operating loss of 2.7 million. Still, investors seemed to be unimpressed, with shares dropping by more than six percent by mid-afternoon. The flag carrier has remained mostly profitable since late 2016, following an era of losses. Pekka Vauramo, who took over as CEO in mid-2013, said he was pleased with the latest stats, as the early part of the year is usually the weakest. \"For the first time in ten years we achieved a profitable comparable operating result in the first quarter, carrying a record three million passengers as well as expanding capacity by nearly one fifth in a quarter that is traditionally the weakest for us,\" said Vauramo. Tougher competition seen on Asian and American routes. Fuel costs, including hedging results and emissions-trading costs, rose by 14 percent. Most of that was due to volume growth, but emission-trading costs was the fastest-growing item in the category. Finnair expects international air travel to grow briskly this year, with increasing competition on routes linking Europe with both Asia and North America. Finnair plans to boost its capacity by more than 15 percent this year, and to carry nearly three million passengers. SK: Share of female pilots declining. Also on Wednesday, the Finnish newsmagazine Suomen Kuvalehti reported that Finnair’s cockpits remain nearly all-male. The airline has wrapped up a pilot recruitment round that began last autumn. Out of 4,200 applicants, it selected 107. Five of them are women. A record 630 female fliers applied, but less than one percent were accepted. Thus the airline’s proportion of women pilots seems to be shrinking. At the end of last year, Finnair had 24 female pilots, nearly three percent of its total 877 pilots.',\n",

The number of stores facing closure is higher than anticipated at the start of the year by Stockmann. Stockmann has announced its plan to shutter several stores in its loss-making fashion chain, Lindex. “As the affordable fashion market is changing rapidly, Lindex will look more closely at its store network. Loss-making stores will be closed,” he said. The closures are especially a consequence of weaker-than-expected market development in Sweden, according to the interim report. Helsingin Sanomat pointed out that the department store retailer shut down a total of six Lindex stores in Finland, Norway, Saudi Arabia and Sweden between January and March. The upcoming closures are to be made in the Nordics, mostly outside Finland. Lindex had a network of 486 stores in 18 countries in March. Stockmann on Friday reported that its first-quarter revenue fell by almost 15 million euros year-on-year to 202 million euros. Its adjusted operating result, on the other hand, improved moderately from the previous year to -25 million euros between January and March. “Our first-quarter performance was at last year's level, as we had estimated. Our revenue declined, but gross margin improved. Our inventories are on a healthy level, and thus there were considerably smaller markdowns in the first quarter than in 2017,” commented Veijalainen. “We expect a similar margin development to continue throughout the rest of the year,” he added. Stockmann also said its real estate business recorded increases in rental income across all markets and that the sales its biannual sales campaign, Crazy Days, rose by 4 per cent due to strong sales in Finland and the Baltics. The campaign sales picked up by as much as 19 per cent on the online store of Stockmann. “Crazy Days is now a truly omni-channel campaign.

       " 'The network equipment manufacturer posted first-quarter net sales of 4.9 billion euros, representing a drop of 500 million euros from the previous year. Its operating profit, in turn, decreased by almost 100 million euros year-on-year to 239 million euros between January and March. Nokia saw its share price fall sharply after it published its interim report for the first quarter of 2018 on Thursday, 26 April. The lacklustre quarter is not a major concern for the iconic company, however. “We see strong momentum building for the full year despite a slow start in networks,” Rajeev Suri, the CEO of Nokia, said in a press release. “I have considerable confidence that Nokia is well-positioned to outperform a strengthening networks market and meet our full-year 2018 guidance.”\\n\\nHis confidence arises particularly from a strong order intake in the first quarter and the expected, large-scale commercial roll-outs of 5G in the United States. “Our end-to-end portfolio positions us very well for 5G and our efforts to accelerate global 5G adoption are clearly delivering results. We will fuel that adoption in 2018 with investments in trial costs, as needed. These investments will position us to capture opportunities in a 5G market that we believe will substantially accelerate later this year in the United States,” stated Suri. Suri also pointed out that the primary reasons for the year-on-year decline in the gross margin of the network business are largely temporary in nature, with improvements expected in the second half of 2018. Nokia, as a result, reaffirmed its guidance for the year. Aleksi Teivainen – HT\\n\\nPhoto: Aku Häyrynen – Lehtikuva',\n",
       " 'The majority state-owned energy company revealed this morning that it submitted the winning bid for implementing the electricity system on the rooftops of approximately 40 commercial buildings owned by S Group, a Finnish retail co-operative, across Finland. Fortum and S Group have come to an agreement on the installation of the largest rooftop solar power system in the Nordics. With a total capacity of roughly 10 megawatts, the system would have accounted for nearly a third of the total solar power capacity of Finland in 2017 and will become the largest rooftop solar power system ever inaugurated in the Nordics. S Group, meanwhile, stated that its objective is to use its renewable energy assets to generate 80 per cent of the energy it consumes in 2025. “The electricity consumption of our sites peaks in the summer, when the sunlight lasts longer and is more intense. The best case scenario is that we can produce enough solar energy to satisfy 100 per cent of the electricity needs of one building in the summer,” told Mikko Halonen, the managing director of S Voima. Fortum, he added, was selected as the supplier of the solar power system because its products and processes are reliable and audited. The Finnish government has pledged to provide 20 per cent of the eight million euros required for the energy project, according to YLE. Aleksi Teivainen – HT\\n\\nPhoto: Linda Manner – Lehtikuva.

       " 'The construction company tells that the lay-offs are necessary to reduce overlap and streamline operations following its consolidation with Lemminkäinen, another major construction company in Finland, in early February, 2018. An equivalent number of employees will leave the combined company through natural attrition – due to retirements and the non-renewals of fixed-term employment contracts, for example. YIT states in a press release that the staff reductions will have no impact on white- and blue-collar employees at its construction sites in Finland. Kari Kauniskangas, the CEO of YIT, says the re-organisation of the new company is progressing on schedule, pointing out that the lay-offs were not as extensive as initially expected due to internal transfers made to satisfy rising labour demand in the construction industry. “We also support those employees who cannot be offered a position in our new organisation, by for example offering tailored coaching promoting re-employment,” he says. YIT, he adds, will continue the re-organisation process by building its new team with a united and strong corporate culture as well as a high level of professionalism and service capabilities. The re-organisation is also expected to result in reductions of up to 200 positions in other countries of operation, mainly in Russia, according to the press release.

As a member of the banking union, we are an excellent domicile for a large bank.”\\n\\nNordea, the largest financial group in Northern Europe, confirmed yesterday in its general meeting that it will re-locate its headquarters from Stockholm, Sweden, to Helsinki, Finland. Orpo estimated that the re-location will have a significant impact on the national economy of Finland. The decision, he added, is also evidence of how attractive an operating environment the country is for large corporations. “We want more headquarters to move to Finland, because they generate value for our national economy. Finland provides a stable operating environment where everything works in an agile way. This government won’t raise the corporate tax or the fees of banks. That would not be in anyone’s best interests,” he stated. Nordea is currently valued at 38.7 billion euros. Orpo described the financial group as a solvent bank with large buffers to absorb losses and bail-ins. The stability, he estimated, will only be increased by the 55-billion-euro common fiscal backstop to be established within the European Union by 2023 and by the banking union advocated by Finland.

Nokia on Tuesday announced it has been selected as the technology partner for a project to develop a space grade 4G network to be built on the Moon. Nokia states in a press release that the network will enable the live-streaming of high-definition video from the Moon to audiences on Earth. The network will also allow scientists to remotely control two lunar quattro vehicles, and enable the vehicles to communicate and transfer data with each other. Marcus Weldon, the chief technology officer at Nokia, says the network equipment manufacturer is pleased to have been selected as the technology partner for the project. “This important mission is supporting, among other things, the development of new space-grade technologies for future data networking, processing and storage, and will help advance the communications infrastructure required for academics, industry and educational institutions in conducting lunar research. These aims have potentially wide-ranging implications for many stakeholders and humanity as a whole,” he says. Robert Böhne, the founder and chief executive of PTScientists, draws attention to the importance of developing extraterrestrial infrastructures. “This is a crucial first step for sustainable exploration of the solar system. In order for humanity to leave the cradle of Earth, we need to develop infrastructures beyond our home planet,” he explains. “The great thing about this LTE solution is that it saves so much power, and the less energy we use sending data, the more we have to do science.”\\n\\nAleksi Teivainen – HT\\n\\nPhoto: Juan Ruiz – AFP/Lehtikuva',\n",
       " 'German car maker Volkswagen experienced a strong start to the year, despite the recent announcement of far-reaching corporate restructuring and the ongoing diesel emissions scandal, the Wolfsburg-based company told press on Thursday. Gross revenue during the first quarter (Q1) of 2018 rose by under four percent to 58.2 billion euros (70.8 billion U.S. dollars) thanks to record sales. Although operating profit fell by around four percent to 4.2 billion euros, this circumstance was mainly due to changes in accounting standards at Volkswagen. Under the company\\'s previous methodology, operating profit in Q1 would have risen as well. Net profit was recorded at 3.3 billion euros, marking a slight decline compared to the same period last year (3.4 billion euros). Newly-appointed chief executive officer Herbert Diess emphasized, however, the outlook for Volkswagen\\'s earnings remained stable. The automotive juggernaut has set itself a goal for revenue growth of up to five percent in the course of 2018 and also wants to increase its operative return between 6.5 and 7.5 percent during the current year. Volkswagen has recently announced the biggest structural reforms in its corporate history following a reshuffle of its executive management. Most significantly, Volkswagen\\'s 12 brands will be combined into six core divisions in an effort to reduce inefficient parallel structures moving forward. Diess will hereby serve simultaneously as the director of the wider Volkswagen Group and the head of its Volkswagen flagship brand. Analysts have predicted that synergy effects produced by the new corporate structure could help the company increase annual operating profits to the level of 25 billion euros within four years. Volkswagen\\'s strong quarterly earnings once again defied concerns that the car maker\\'s involvement in the ongoing \"dieselgate\" scandal could weigh on its financial performance. Investors reacted positively to figures released by the company, and the share price of Volkswagen stocks rose by more than four percent in early Thursday trading.',\n",

The 315 meter cruise ship is based on a new design, which is an evolution from the very successful Mein Schiff series, said a press release. New Mein Schiff 1 is already the fifth Mein Schiff ship built by Meyer Turku for TUI Cruises. New Mein Schiff 1 will sail to Hamburg from Turku to be christened there on the 11th of May. She will begin operation shortly after. “The impressive new 50m wide steel and glass window structure that makes up the new Diamond at the aft of the ship just above the propellers is a good example how we combine architectural design with our engineering skills supported by sophisticated computer models. Innovations, strengthening our Turku team and our 200million Euro investments in Finland well in advance are our way to compete with our mostly government owned and supported competitors”, said Jan Meyer, the CEO of Meyer Turku. Environmental friendliness was also in focus in the design of New Mein Schiff 1. Each Mein Schiff marks another step in energy efficiency improvement and with New Mein Schiff 1 Meyer Turku is making another big step ahead by engineering it for a 10% energy efficiency improvement compared to last year’s Mein Schiff 6. Mein Schiff 1 is one of the first cruise ships to be equipped with catalytic converters for the main and auxiliary engines, reducing nitrogen oxide emissions. “I am very thankful to our customer TUI cruises to embark and engage in this innovation journey with us and continue it with the recently ordered Mein Schiff 7”, the CEO said. “On our tenth anniversary, we are giving ourselves and our guests the gift of a new Mein Schiff 1, which marks the starting point for a new generation of ships. We will proceed with this expansion over the next year with the new Mein Schiff 2. In 2023, the Mein Schiff 7, another ship in this class, will continue the trend,” said CEO of TUI Cruises Wybcke Meier. At the shipyard, New Mein Schiff 2 is already under construction and TUI Cruises recently ordered a third sister ship to New Mein Schiff 1 & 2 for delivery from Turku in 2023, which will be called ‘Mein Schiff 7’.',\n",

       " 'The Finnish economic growth is set to keep its strong path this and next year, but the upward trend will be at a standstill after a couple of years, said Nordea Bank on Tuesday. The Finnish economy will grow by 3 percent in 2018 and 2.5 percent in 2019, said Nordea, adding that household consumption will take over the role of key growth engine from exports and investment, thanks to positive labor market developments. However, the bank warned that the growth will start to deteriorate at the turn of the decade. One of the major reasons is that the improved competitiveness in recent years can turn even to a deteriorating track, according to Aki Kangasharju, chief economist at Nordea Bank. The earnings level will rise this and next year by 2 percent. At the same time, the euro will remain strong in the near future. \"During the economic cycle, Finland\\'s productivity growth will be fast, but now, with the improvement of employment, it has faded again. It is difficult to imagine that the productivity growth will accelerate to over one percent over the next a few years,\" said Kangasharju. The worsening labor shortage and the decline of exports are also risk factors to the Finnish economic growth. Furthermore, the economy is vulnerable to a significant escalation of trade tensions, and even an increase in uncertainty may be enough to cut international investment growth, which would mean slower export growth for Finland, noted Nordea. Following three consecutive years of negative growth, the Finnish economy finally started to show some signs of recovery in 2015. Since 2016, the economy has grown gradually and achieved a bullish growth by 3.2 percent in 2017.',\n",

Releasing its latest quarterly report, Apple announced it had sold 52.2m iPhones in the quarter ending 31 March, at an average price of $728.54. Sales were up 3% compared to last year and slightly lower than analysts had expected, but numbers beat the gloomiest forecasts and were enough to deliver Apple its best second quarter ever, with revenues of over $61bn.

Apple sold 9.11m iPads and 4.08m Macs over the quarter. Analysts had worried that the high-priced iPhone X would dent sales. The results came after Apple suppliers including AMS and Taiwan Semiconductors have reported slowing revenues in a sign seen by analysts as proof of shaky demand for iPhone X. The company announced it would be adding $100bn to its stock buyback programme, plus a 16% increase in its quarterly dividend. Taking advantage of the Trump administration’s new tax laws, Apple is in the process of repatriating the majority of the $252bn in profits it currently holds overseas. The buyback helped Apple’s shares rise over 5% in after-hours trading. The company’s stock has risen by about 80% in the past two years, setting it on course to battle Amazon to become the first company to be valued at $1tn. But Apple’s share price has stumbled recently as fears about slowing iPhone sales took their toll. The iPhone remains Apple’s biggest product, even as sales of services and other items, including the Apple Watch, have grown. Services – from the Apple Store, iCloud, Apple Pay and others – generated $9bn over the quarter. But the 11-year-old mobile device accounts for the majority Apple’s revenues and contributed $100bn over the quarter. Despite the better-than-expected results, however, sales are slowing.

       " 'Herbert Diess, the new chief executive officer (CEO) of Volkswagen, announced on Friday that he will speed up an ongoing process of far-reaching corporate reform at the German carmaker. During his first speech as CEO, Diess told press that his goal was the \"continued development\" of the Wolfsburg-based automotive giant. He emphasized that he is not about to start a \"revolution\" but instead hereby hope to build on initiatives already launched under his predecessor Matthias Mueller. \"Our aim is to make Volkswagen an industry leader with regards to profitability, innovation and sustainability,\" Diess said. In the future, management would be able to make decisions more quickly, not least thanks to a new division of labor in the corporation. Diess took the reins of Volkswagen following an emergency supervisory board meeting which was convened in reaction to wild media speculation over a looming personnel shake-up. The 60-year-old Austrian was formerly the director of the company flagship brand Volkswagen. Speaking on Friday, Diess praised his predecessor Mueller for successfully steering Volkswagen through the \"dieselgate\" scandal. \"Volkswagen is in a more robust operative and strategic position than ever,\" board chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch seconded. The appointment of Diess as CEO coincides with the most significant corporate restructuring in Volkswagen\\'s history. The company confirmed on Friday that, moving forward, the group will be divided into six independent units, with all China-related business being led as a division of its own. A \"volume group\" will combine the mass-appeal brands Volkswagen, Skoda and Seat, alongside a \"super-premium group\" including Porsche, Bugatti, Bentley and Lamborghini, and a \"premium group\" constituted by Audi. Additionally, a \"commercial utility holding\" encompassing truck and bus production (MAN, Scania) will be created and prepared for an initial public offering (IPO). Diess will simultaneously act as corporate CEO, head of research & development, and head of the volume group, but will receive assistance from a yet-to-be-appointed operative manager to deal with day-to-day demands.

       " 'US telecoms giant T-Mobile has agreed to buy its rival Sprint in a $26bn (£18.9bn) deal. The merger of America\\'s third and fourth largest mobile carriers is designed to create a more competitive firm with about 130 million customers. However, the deal is expected to attract regulatory scrutiny over its potential impact on customer prices. T-Mobile boss John Legere said the new firm would spend $40bn on building a 5G mobile network in the next three years. \"Together, we will build the highest-capacity mobile network in US history!! I\\'m talking 30X more capacity than T-Mobile today!!\" he said in one of a series of Tweets. It comes after months of negotiations between T-Mobile\\'s controlling shareholder, Deutsche Telekom, and Japan\\'s SoftBank, which controls Sprint. Under the deal, Deutsche Telekom will own 42% of the combined company and control its board. Softbank will hold a 27% stake. Mr Legere will lead the new firm which will take the T-Mobile name and have a market value of $146bn. Analysts say the combined company will have more clout to compete with the first and second biggest US telecoms firms, Verizon and AT&T, each of which have more than 100 million subscribers. In particular, they say it will be better positioned in the race to provide America with next generation 5G mobile broadband technology. They also believe that, without T-Mobile, Sprint lacks the scale needed to upgrade its network. Competition concerns. Sprint and T-Mobile had been in talks about a potential tie-up since 2014, when the Obama administration scuppered a previous merger attempt over competition concerns. Under the Trump administration, regulators have continued to challenge deals they believe could push up prices and are likely to scrutinise this latest takeover closely. It has also allegedly opened a probe into claims of co-ordination by AT&T, Verizon and a telecoms standards body to hinder consumers from easily switching provider, Reuters reported earlier in April. In a statement, Mr Legere said the merger between Sprint and T-Mobile would lower prices and help the US accelerate its development of 5G, amid fierce competition from China. He also said it would create tens of thousands of jobs in rural America - factors analysts say could help sway officials in the Trump administration. \"This combination will create a fierce competitor with the network scale to deliver more for consumers and businesses in the form of lower prices, more innovation, and a second-to-none network experience - and do it all so much faster than either company could on its own,\" Mr Legere said.',\n",
       " 'Sainsbury\\'s has confirmed plans to merge with Asda, which is currently owned by US supermarket giant Walmart. The supermarkets said that grocery prices would fall in both chains as a result of the merger. Sainsbury\\'s chief executive Mike Coupe also said the deal would not lead to store closures or job losses in stores. The combination of the UK\\'s second and third largest supermarkets would create a giant, representing nearly £1 in every £3 spent on groceries. Mr Coupe - who will lead the new combined group - said he believed the two supermarkets were \"the best possible fit\". Shares in Sainsbury\\'s jumped 15% in response to the merger news. Walmart, which has owned Asda since 1999, will retain 42% of the combined business. What will the merger mean for shoppers? The supermarkets say that as a result of the merger, they expect to be able to lower prices \"by around 10% on many of the products customers buy regularly\". Sainsbury\\'s and Asda will remain separate brands and no stores will close, Mr Coupe told the BBC. \"There\\'s been a bit of commentary over the weekend where people have been alluding to the fact that the only way of making this happen is by closing stores - that is not true,\" said Mr Coupe. Following the merger Argos will open outlets within Asda stores, the firms said. Sainsbury\\'s took over Argos in 2016 and has been integrating the catalogue retailer into its own stores. Sainsbury\\'s said it couldn\\'t comment on what would happen to customers\\' Nectar points after the merger. What will it mean for suppliers? The combined business will overtake current market leader Tesco, representing around 30% of UK grocery sales. That will give it greater muscle in the market. Labour\\'s shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told the BBC she was concerned at the impact on suppliers of the proposed tie-up. The combined group \"will have immense purchasing power, giving them an opportunity to bargain very hard with suppliers,\" she warned. Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the firms should explain how they plan to merge their supply chains fairly, and reassure people that cost savings wouldn\\'t be achieved \"simply by milking their small suppliers for all they\\'re worth\". Sainsbury\\'s and Asda executives said one advantage of the merger would be the opportunity to bring in \"the power of Walmart in the form of buying of general merchandise and in the form of their systems and investments\". Will the merger be allowed? A competition probe seems inevitable given the size of the two chains and the UK\\'s competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), said on Monday it was \"likely\" to review the merger. Sainsbury\\'s and Asda have asked for the CMA investigation to be fast-tracked and hope to complete the deal by the autumn of 2019. At the weekend, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the merger risked creating \"even more concentrated local monopolies\" and said the CMA should force the companies to sell off stores if the new giant was dominant in a particular area. Retail analyst Nick Bubb said he thought there was \"a pretty good chance\" that the deal will be allowed to proceed, but the main debate would be over how many stores Sainsbury\\'s and Asda would have to sell \"to placate the CMA\". \"Too many store disposals and the deal won\\'t be worth doing... too few store disposals and the CMA will look toothless… hopefully there will be a \"Goldilocks\" scenario for Sainsbury\\'s/Asda.\" Why are the two chains combining? Sainsbury\\'s and Asda are both being buffeted by competition from budget supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl. On the horizon, Amazon is making initial steps into grocery deliveries. \"I think from a market share perspective, both Sainsbury\\'s and Asda are landlocked to a certain extent. They\\'re not really able to grow at a rapid rate,\" said Steve Dresser, director of the Grocery Insight consultancy. \"If they remain on their own it\\'s difficult to see how they get any real growth beyond standard organic growth, which isn\\'t necessarily going to be enough when Amazon joins the market,\" said Mr Dresser. The two chains are in many ways complementary: Sainsbury\\'s stores are focused more in the south of the UK and target a higher-end market segment. Asda is more concentrated in the north, offering lower-cost groceries. Even after reducing prices for customers, Mike Coupe thinks synergies will generate £500m of extra savings, in part through taking advantage of Walmart\\'s clout with suppliers. As for Walmart they will receive £3bn as well as their 42% stake in the company. But the deal also offers Walmart the option of exiting the UK market altogether in four years\\' time.',\n",

The UK is one of the strongest markets for McDonald\\'s, reporting 12 years of consistent quarterly growth.

The US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) said Panasonic also overstated profits in one quarter in 2012 by backdating an agreement with an airline. The firm has since \"separated\" several executives involved in or aware of the \"misconduct\", according to the US Justice Department. It has also improved its internal controls. The fine includes $143m to resolve the charges from the SEC, a financial regulator, as well as $137.4m for the charges brought by the US Justice Department.',\n",
       " 'A former senior executive at the UK software firm Autonomy has been convicted of fraud in the United States. It is the first judgement in a legal battle that has raged since Hewlett Packard bought the firm in 2011. Former chief financial officer Sushovan Hussain was found guilty of artificially inflating the firm\\'s financial position before it was sold. Mr Hussain\\'s lawyers say he will appeal against the judgement. Prosecutors argued that starting in 2009, senior managers at Autonomy, which was one of the UK\\'s largest software companies, sought to inflate the company\\'s share price and make the firm more attractive to potential buyers by artificially boosting the number of transactions on its balance sheet. After HP bought Autonomy for £7.1bn in 2011, the US tech giant said it had uncovered accounting irregularities. A year later, it was forced to write off most of the value of the software firm. Autonomy\\'s founder and chief executive, Mike Lynch, a former Cambridge researcher, vehemently rejected HP\\'s claims that management misled HP over the company\\'s value. He said HP had concocted the accusations to distract from their own mismanagement and poor performance. Mr Lynch and Mr Hussain, both British citizens, are also facing a civil case in London, as HP sues them for damages. Mr Hussain was found guilty on all 16 charges, in what prosecutors claimed amounted to an \"unsustainable Ponzi scheme\" during the 10 years he managed the firm\\'s finances. He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution, for each charge. Sentencing will take place on Friday. Revenue \\'manipulated\\'\\n\\nHewlett Packard issued a statement saying it was pleased with the verdict. \"As we have consistently maintained, Mr Hussain engaged in outright fraud and deliberately misled the market about non-existent sales through a series of calculated sham transactions,\" it said. \"Autonomy manipulated their revenue, and quarterly results, making an accurate valuation impossible. \"That Mr Hussain attempted to depict the fraud as nothing more than a misunderstanding of international accounting rules was, and still remains, patently ridiculous - and the jury has now held him accountable for his role in defrauding HP.\" Mr Hussain pleaded not guilty in the trial, which took place in San Francisco. \"Mr Hussain defrauded no one and acted at all times with the highest standards of honesty, integrity and competence,\" said his lawyer, John Keker. \"It is a shame that the United States Department of Justice lent its support to HP\\'s campaign to blame others for its own catastrophic failings.\" He said important evidence that backed up Mr Hussain\\'s defence had been excluded from the trial.',\n",
       " 'Nissan is to cut hundreds of jobs at its Sunderland car plant, as diesel sales decline. The carmaker builds its Qashqai and Juke models at the north-eastern England site, where it employs 7,000 people. As well as a fall in the demand for its diesel cars, the job losses relate to a switch in production to newer models. The job cuts follow those at Jaguar Land Rover, which last week said it would shed 1,000 contract staff. A Nissan spokesman said: \"As previously communicated, we are transitioning to a new range of powertrains over the next year. \"As we make the operational changes required to support this, we will be managing a planned short-term reduction in powertrain supply and plant volumes at NMUK in line with our 2018 Business Plan. We are now discussing these operational changes with our employees.\" Employees will be offered a financial package and the chance to be retrained if they choose to leave. Across the UK demand for diesel vehicles fell by a third in the first three months of this year. Nissan said it expected production volumes to recover as it begins to make the new models. Future investment. In 2016, following the vote to leave the European Union, Nissan confirmed it would build new models at its Sunderland plant, the largest vehicle production site in the UK. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it was \"working with the industry to ensure that the UK is at the forefront of new automotive technologies and remains the destination of choice for future investment\". Unite\\'s acting national officer Steve Bush said the union was working with Nissan \"to minimise job losses associated with a short-term reduction in volumes at the carmaker\\'s Sunderland plant\". \"Going forward we expect to see temporary workers at the plant move into permanent positions as volumes pick up again in future years,\" he said.',\n",
       " 'Uncertainty about the future of diesel is threatening the UK car industry and leaving drivers in limbo, according to Ford\\'s UK boss. Andy Barratt said consumers were buying fewer diesel cars, fearing they were polluting and will face new taxes. However, he claimed new diesels were \"every bit as clean\" as petrol cars. Government and industry must do more to reassure consumers, Mr Barratt warned, given there had already been job cuts as diesel sales slide. Diesel is vital to the UK industry as it makes almost a million diesel engines a year, most of which are exported. \"There has been a lot of chaos in the signalling and in the messaging around diesel and there have been job losses,\" Mr Barratt said. \"The poor motorist just doesn\\'t know what to do - we need to clarify where diesel works and where it doesn\\'t.\" Are diesels cars always the biggest health hazard? Diesel cars: Your questions answered. While some diesel engines produce fewer CO2 emissions than their petrol equivalents, many experts say petrol remains the cleaner option. Diesel cars emit nitrogen oxide, a significant contributor to pollution in cities that can cause respiratory diseases. Diesel car sales fell by 37% this March compared with last year, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) and further falls are forecast for 2018. Consumer confidence has been hit as politicians became more focused on air quality, and potential customers are worried about new regulations and taxes. Mr Barratt said the car industry needed to \"step up\" and offer a clearer message to reassure drivers, but that the government should do more as well. \"Fortunately our Dagenham plant has increased production based around exports and the demand for commercial vehicles that we have,\" he said. \"But there is no doubt there is a real crisis of confidence among consumers.\" In December, the SMMT said falling business and consumer confidence was \"being exacerbated by ongoing anti-diesel messages from government\". \"Diesel remains the right choice for many drivers, not least because of its fuel economy and lower CO2 emissions,\" boss Mike Hawes said. This month both Jaguar Land Rover and Nissan have announced job cuts at UK plants because of falling diesel sales.',\n",
       " 'Companies that supply products to Sainsbury\\'s and Asda fear they could suffer when the two grocery chains merge. Sainsbury\\'s boss Mike Coupe has pledged to cut prices on everyday products by around 10% after the deal. But suppliers fear they will have to shoulder the cost of those savings. \"There will be plenty of losers from this,\" said Austin Sugarman, boss of Fine Foods International, a supplier of instant coffee based in Bedfordshire. \"If suppliers are going to have to come up with the savings, then we\\'ll see consolidation in the supply base,\" he told the BBC. Mr Coupe said the combined group\\'s buying power would enable it to strike better deals with suppliers, and these savings would then be passed on to consumers. But industry bodies fear this will make life very difficult for smaller suppliers, who are already having to adapt to higher costs from auto-enrolment pensions and the Living Wage, as well as the weaker pound since the Brexit vote. \"We already operate in a very competitive retail environment,\" said Gordon Polson, director of the Federation of Bakers. \"We just don\\'t see possibly how our products could be reduced any further.\" Ian Cass, managing director of the Forum of Private Business agreed: \"If suppliers are asked to reduce prices by 10% to stay on the Sainsbury\\'s-Asda supply chain, then some small companies could go out of business.\" Mr Cass was concerned that the combined company - which will be Britain\\'s biggest grocer - could seek to pressure suppliers into unfavourable terms by holding the threat of losing contracts over their heads. He cited Arcadia Group, which owns brands such as Topshop and Dorothy Perkins as an example. In January, the firm imposed a 2% discount on all current and existing orders from suppliers due to poor Christmas sales. On top of all these pressures, suppliers also have to contend with the fact that many retailers in the grocery industry make suppliers wait up to three months for payment. \"Surely there are other efficiencies you could make in partnership with suppliers, other than turning around and demanding a 10% discount,\" Mr Cass said. A better deal? Sentinel Management Consultants acts as an adviser to suppliers on their negotiations with supermarkets. It said that while some suppliers will undoubtedly be \"quaking with fear\" after the Sainsbury\\'s-Asda merger announcement, others will have more power to negotiate with the new firm than they realise. \"Suppliers need to get better at saying no,\" said Sentinel boss David Sables. Mr Sables said small businesses should make sure they understand their rights under the Groceries Supply Code of Practice, and also understand that supermarket chains tend to hold the threat of getting rid of suppliers as a bluff. \"There is a game being played about the demand for cheaper prices, and very often when suppliers have said no and they\\'re walking away, nine times out of 10 that\\'s the price they get the contract to supply at.\" A Sainsbury\\'s spokeswoman told the BBC that suppliers would benefit from the deal. \"At this stage, we are still in the early phases of our plans but we believe this is a great opportunity for suppliers as they will be able to make their supply chains more streamlined, to develop differentiated product ranges and to grow their businesses as we grow ours. \"We are also actively investing in small suppliers - we are recruiting a team which is dedicated to working with smaller and distinctive suppliers to help them bring new products to market and to handhold them through this process.\"',\n",
       " 'Could the Bank of England soon pop up among your Spotify playlist followers? Its chief economist has hinted that analysis of people\\'s music choices could be a useful tool and give a \"window on their soul\". In a speech about new possibilities in data analytics, Andy Haldane said data on downloads from Spotify had been used to gain an insight into people\\'s mood. Book lists, TV choices and even computer games could also be used to gauge consumer confidence. He said: \"To give one recent example, data on music downloads from Spotify has been used, in tandem with semantic search techniques applied to the words of songs, to provide an indicator of people\\'s sentiment.\" He said the results did at least as well in tracking consumer spending as the well-regarded Michigan survey of consumer confidence in the US. Mr Haldane said games such as EVE Online and World of Warcraft were particularly useful as they had primitive economies which allowed goods and money to change hands between players. He said some economists had in fact begun to use gaming technologies to understand behaviour and could be used to explore behaviour in a virtual economy by studying player reactions to certain changes in policy. Mr Haldane is known for his attempts to broaden the Bank\\'s knowledge base. Last month, he invited left-wing activist and singer songwriter Billy Bragg into the Bank\\'s Threadneedle Street headquarters to give a talk.']"

       "[\"Of all the accommodation available in Helsinki, about 20 percent is covered by Airbnb – an online service where private individuals can rent rooms or whole properties to visitors. Researcher Pekka Mustonen from Helsinki city administration says that statistics compiled by AirDNA show that there were 2,300 Airbnb-accommodations available in Helsinki last year. In contrast, the number of hotel rooms totaled 10,000. However that does not mean that a fifth of all overnight stays in Helsinki occurred in Airbnb-rooms, Mustonen says. “Hotels in Helsinki are boring”\\n\\nImage: Ronnie Holmberg / Yle. Anna Varakas has been renting her property in Ullanlinna through Airbnb for two years, and says that the demand for the 20 square metre flat close to the seafront has increased over time. Varakas understands why visitors to Helsinki are interested in Airbnb. “In my opinion, the selection of hotels in Helsinki is rather boring. In terms of quality and price, Airbnb has a lot to offer,” she says. According to her, a typical guest is a German or British couple working in a creative industry. On the other hand, she has not accommodated many Asian tourists. Regulation of Airbnb planned. The figures of Helsinki's Airbnb beds became as a surprise to Mustonen and Laura Aalto, the chief executive at Helsinki Marketing. “We all know that in large European cities Airbnb is huge. But it has perhaps not occurred to us that here in Helsinki there are thousands of places on offer at all times,” Mustonen says. Aalto considers the news on Airbnb positive for Helsinki tourism, as last year the city recorded four million overnight stays for the first time ever. Airbnb provides flexibility to the supply of traditional accommodation and both are needed, she says. Nonetheless the city of Helsinki plans to introduce rules for residents who want to rent their property through Airbnb. Planning work for the system of regulations is due to begin this spring. Aalto denies that the purpose is to slow down the Airbnb market. “It is important for the city to do something before this turns into a problem. For example, rents could rise or certain areas of the city become exclusive to Airbnb guests.”\\n\\nHotels and hostels lose. Among Finland’s largest cities, Helsinki has the most to offer in terms of Airbnb housing, while Espoo, Tampere, Vantaa and Oulu are far behind. Outside of the most populated areas, Rovaniemi offers close to 400 Airbnb properties. Last year, the sales generated by Airbnb are estimated to total 58 million euros in Finland, of which 24 million comes from Helsinki. Timo Lappi from the Finnish Hospitality Association says the growth of Airbnb is not necessarily good news. “When Airbnb grows and becomes a business-like activity, hotels and hostels lose,” Lappi says. According to Lappi, Airbnb used to be part of the sharing economy, but it has now turned into a professional business. Investors may buy several flats in a building and engage in a full-time accommodation business without establishing a hotel, Lappi says. Varakas, the Airbnb host from Ullanlinna, disagrees. Airbnb is changing the market in a way that hotels do not like, she says. “I don’t know of any other industry where professionalism is considered a threat.”\",\n",

The company believes this will bring the company a small improvement to the financial results for the year 2018. Finnish sports equipment and apparel company Amer Sports has acquired all the shares in Peak Performance. The company known for it's premium sports gear was sold by Danish fashion company IC Group. The total price is 255 Million euros, and it will be financed with cash assets as well as bank financing. Peak Performance is a Swedish brand, whose turnover for the last reported 12 month period was 145 Million euros. During this period the company made a profit of some 15,6 Million euros. Over 40 percent of sales come from women's apparel. A total of 45 percent of sales come from the company's own retail activities. Amer Sports is a company that designs and manufactures sports equipment and apparel with a number of different brands, such as Atomic, Arc’teryx, Mavic, Wilson, Salomon and Suunto. The company was founded in 1950 in Tuusula. For the first 54 years the primary business of Amer was tobacco products, including the production of Marlboro cigarettes. In 2004 the company gave up the bad habit and focused on sports. Since that it has acquired a number of brands, with the latest notable one being the acquision of the Armada ski brand in 2017. The purchase of Peak Perofmrance is expected to have a slightly positive effect for Amer Sport's financial year 2018 results.

       " \"The Koskenkorva booze factory runs 12 hour working shifts instead of 8h ones. Altia's Koskenkorva factory in South Pohjanmaa uses abnormally long twelve hour shifts. The facility produces grain alcohol, starch, livestock feed and carbon dioxide. A trial started the longer working days in 2014, due to problems with excessive over time work. It is now standard practise. The highly automated factory employs some 50 people direcly. In addition it provides work for some 30 outsourced workers. A single production shift runs on three members of staff: One is on the control panel controlling the process and making required. Another is on the factory floor collecting samples and supervising dry materials. The third is controlling ethanol production. After the year long trial ended in 2014 no employees wanted to return to regular eight hour shifts. The factory made a local agreement that can be terminated by the employer or the employees single sidedly. So far both parties have been happy with the agreements. Longer working hours for longer breaks between days. In the current arrangement 15 process controllers and two extras follow a schedule where working days are 12 hour long. The switchover point between for the shifts is always at six o'clock. Morning shifts at the Koskenkorva factory start at 6 AM and end at 6 PM. The 12h work routine 12 hour day shift 12 hour day shift 24 hour break 12 hour night shift 12 hour night shift Sleeping day Day off Day off Day off Day off Day off. After two shifts there is a 24 hour break for sleeping. This is followed by two night shifts spanning from 6 PM to 6 AM. After this there is 1 day for sleeping and 6 days off for a total of 6 consecutive days of leisure. Altia has benefited from the change, which has allowed more effective use of the work force. It seems like a win win, as employees are tempted by the long breaks offered by the scheduling. Experts belive that two 12 hour night shifts are easier for the body to recover from, than four 8 hour shifts. According Timo Mantere a six day break every ten days feels like holiday each time. Longer consecutive breaks make child care easier and also gives more opportunities to focus hobbies. Mantere, for example, has picked up his competitive skiing after being able to train more consistently. Other companies in Finland are also interested in adopting 12 hour shifts. However 12 hour shifts are not suitable for all kinds of work. During longer shifts the risk of accidents grows in physical work and productivity in cognitive tasks lowers.

The umbers were significantly worse than market expectations. In a positive statement, Nokia CFO Kristian Pullola believes that the strong demand for fifth generation (5G) network equipment will improve results in the third quarter and beyond. After the announcement of the results before markets open, the Nokia stock, traded on the Helsinki stock exchange, was down significantly by 7%. In the first quarter the telecoms giant had trouble in the US market. As a result quarterly profit sank to 239 Million euros - a drop of 100 Million year over year. It must be noted that Q1/2017 was exceptionally strong for Nokia. The markets were expecting a significantly better results, especially after the Swedish competitor Ericsson reported strong results just a week before. Chinese ZTE manufacturer facing trouble in the US market also fueled expectations in the stock for the last few weeks. Nokia remains bullish on the future of 5G cellullar networks. The deployment of the next generation technology is expected to being at scale in the United States in the autumn of 2018, followed by adoption by operators in China, Japan, South Korea and the Nordics. The company admits the first quarter results were a dissapointment, but expects the setbacks to be temporary. In general the company sees it's future prospects as good. Field testing cost of 5G equipment will grow from the expected 100 Million euros to somewhere between 100-200 MEUR. This upfront is planned to be recouped when deliveries begin.

       " 'Finnair has posted its 14th consecutive quarter of growth, with a profit of nearly four million euros from January through March. The airline’s comparable operating result swung to a profit of 3.9 million euros. During the same period of last year it lost nine million euros. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had expected an operating loss of 2.7 million. Still, investors seemed to be unimpressed, with shares dropping by more than six percent by mid-afternoon. The flag carrier has remained mostly profitable since late 2016, following an era of losses. Pekka Vauramo, who took over as CEO in mid-2013, said he was pleased with the latest stats, as the early part of the year is usually the weakest. \"For the first time in ten years we achieved a profitable comparable operating result in the first quarter, carrying a record three million passengers as well as expanding capacity by nearly one fifth in a quarter that is traditionally the weakest for us,\" said Vauramo. Tougher competition seen on Asian and American routes. Fuel costs, including hedging results and emissions-trading costs, rose by 14 percent. Most of that was due to volume growth, but emission-trading costs was the fastest-growing item in the category. Finnair expects international air travel to grow briskly this year, with increasing competition on routes linking Europe with both Asia and North America. Finnair plans to boost its capacity by more than 15 percent this year, and to carry nearly three million passengers. SK: Share of female pilots declining. Also on Wednesday, the Finnish newsmagazine Suomen Kuvalehti reported that Finnair’s cockpits remain nearly all-male. The airline has wrapped up a pilot recruitment round that began last autumn. Out of 4,200 applicants, it selected 107. Five of them are women. A record 630 female fliers applied, but less than one percent were accepted. Thus the airline’s proportion of women pilots seems to be shrinking. At the end of last year, Finnair had 24 female pilots, nearly three percent of its total 877 pilots.',\n",
       " \"Lauri Veijalainen, the CEO of Stockmann, on Friday revealed in the department store retailer’s first-quarter interim report that over 20 Lindex stores will be closed by the end of the year. The number of stores facing closure is higher than anticipated at the start of the year by Stockmann. Stockmann has announced its plan to shutter several stores in its loss-making fashion chain, Lindex. “As the affordable fashion market is changing rapidly, Lindex will look more closely at its store network. Loss-making stores will be closed,” he said. The closures are especially a consequence of weaker-than-expected market development in Sweden, according to the interim report. Helsingin Sanomat pointed out that the department store retailer shut down a total of six Lindex stores in Finland, Norway, Saudi Arabia and Sweden between January and March. The upcoming closures are to be made in the Nordics, mostly outside Finland. Lindex had a network of 486 stores in 18 countries in March. Stockmann on Friday reported that its first-quarter revenue fell by almost 15 million euros year-on-year to 202 million euros. Its adjusted operating result, on the other hand, improved moderately from the previous year to -25 million euros between January and March. “Our first-quarter performance was at last year's level, as we had estimated. Our revenue declined, but gross margin improved. Our inventories are on a healthy level, and thus there were considerably smaller markdowns in the first quarter than in 2017,” commented Veijalainen. “We expect a similar margin development to continue throughout the rest of the year,” he added. Stockmann also said its real estate business recorded increases in rental income across all markets and that the sales its biannual sales campaign, Crazy Days, rose by 4 per cent due to strong sales in Finland and the Baltics. The campaign sales picked up by as much as 19 per cent on the online store of Stockmann. “Crazy Days is now a truly omni-channel campaign. The successful campaign gives us a solid start to the spring sales,” rejoiced Veijalainen. The Crazy Days campaign was held this spring between 11 and 15 April.

Its operating profit, in turn, decreased by almost 100 million euros year-on-year to 239 million euros between January and March. Nokia saw its share price fall sharply after it published its interim report for the first quarter of 2018 on Thursday, 26 April. The lacklustre quarter is not a major concern for the iconic company, however. “We see strong momentum building for the full year despite a slow start in networks,” Rajeev Suri, the CEO of Nokia, said in a press release. “I have considerable confidence that Nokia is well-positioned to outperform a strengthening networks market and meet our full-year 2018 guidance.”\\n\\nHis confidence arises particularly from a strong order intake in the first quarter and the expected, large-scale commercial roll-outs of 5G in the United States. “Our end-to-end portfolio positions us very well for 5G and our efforts to accelerate global 5G adoption are clearly delivering results. We will fuel that adoption in 2018 with investments in trial costs, as needed. These investments will position us to capture opportunities in a 5G market that we believe will substantially accelerate later this year in the United States,” stated Suri. Suri also pointed out that the primary reasons for the year-on-year decline in the gross margin of the network business are largely temporary in nature, with improvements expected in the second half of 2018.

Fortum and S Group have come to an agreement on the installation of the largest rooftop solar power system in the Nordics. With a total capacity of roughly 10 megawatts, the system would have accounted for nearly a third of the total solar power capacity of Finland in 2017 and will become the largest rooftop solar power system ever inaugurated in the Nordics. S Group, meanwhile, stated that its objective is to use its renewable energy assets to generate 80 per cent of the energy it consumes in 2025. “The electricity consumption of our sites peaks in the summer, when the sunlight lasts longer and is more intense. The best case scenario is that we can produce enough solar energy to satisfy 100 per cent of the electricity needs of one building in the summer,” told Mikko Halonen, the managing director of S Voima. Fortum, he added, was selected as the supplier of the solar power system because its products and processes are reliable and audited.

YIT states in a press release that the staff reductions will have no impact on white- and blue-collar employees at its construction sites in Finland. Kari Kauniskangas, the CEO of YIT, says the re-organisation of the new company is progressing on schedule, pointing out that the lay-offs were not as extensive as initially expected due to internal transfers made to satisfy rising labour demand in the construction industry. “We also support those employees who cannot be offered a position in our new organisation, by for example offering tailored coaching promoting re-employment,” he says. YIT, he adds, will continue the re-organisation process by building its new team with a united and strong corporate culture as well as a high level of professionalism and service capabilities.

Orpo estimated that the re-location will have a significant impact on the national economy of Finland. The decision, he added, is also evidence of how attractive an operating environment the country is for large corporations. “We want more headquarters to move to Finland, because they generate value for our national economy. Finland provides a stable operating environment where everything works in an agile way. This government won’t raise the corporate tax or the fees of banks. That would not be in anyone’s best interests,” he stated. Nordea is currently valued at 38.7 billion euros. Orpo described the financial group as a solvent bank with large buffers to absorb losses and bail-ins. The stability, he estimated, will only be increased by the 55-billion-euro common fiscal backstop to be established within the European Union by 2023 and by the banking union advocated by Finland.

Nokia on Tuesday announced it has been selected as the technology partner for a project to develop a space grade 4G network to be built on the Moon. Nokia states in a press release that the network will enable the live-streaming of high-definition video from the Moon to audiences on Earth. The network will also allow scientists to remotely control two lunar quattro vehicles, and enable the vehicles to communicate and transfer data with each other. Marcus Weldon, the chief technology officer at Nokia, says the network equipment manufacturer is pleased to have been selected as the technology partner for the project. “This important mission is supporting, among other things, the development of new space-grade technologies for future data networking, processing and storage, and will help advance the communications infrastructure required for academics, industry and educational institutions in conducting lunar research.

       " 'German car maker Volkswagen experienced a strong start to the year, despite the recent announcement of far-reaching corporate restructuring and the ongoing diesel emissions scandal, the Wolfsburg-based company told press on Thursday. Gross revenue during the first quarter (Q1) of 2018 rose by under four percent to 58.2 billion euros (70.8 billion U.S. dollars) thanks to record sales. Although operating profit fell by around four percent to 4.2 billion euros, this circumstance was mainly due to changes in accounting standards at Volkswagen. Under the company\\'s previous methodology, operating profit in Q1 would have risen as well. Net profit was recorded at 3.3 billion euros, marking a slight decline compared to the same period last year (3.4 billion euros). Newly-appointed chief executive officer Herbert Diess emphasized, however, the outlook for Volkswagen\\'s earnings remained stable. The automotive juggernaut has set itself a goal for revenue growth of up to five percent in the course of 2018 and also wants to increase its operative return between 6.5 and 7.5 percent during the current year. Volkswagen has recently announced the biggest structural reforms in its corporate history following a reshuffle of its executive management. Most significantly, Volkswagen\\'s 12 brands will be combined into six core divisions in an effort to reduce inefficient parallel structures moving forward. Diess will hereby serve simultaneously as the director of the wider Volkswagen Group and the head of its Volkswagen flagship brand. Analysts have predicted that synergy effects produced by the new corporate structure could help the company increase annual operating profits to the level of 25 billion euros within four years. Volkswagen\\'s strong quarterly earnings once again defied concerns that the car maker\\'s involvement in the ongoing \"dieselgate\" scandal could weigh on its financial performance. Investors reacted positively to figures released by the company, and the share price of Volkswagen stocks rose by more than four percent in early Thursday trading.',\n",

New Mein Schiff 1 is already the fifth Mein Schiff ship built by Meyer Turku for TUI Cruises. New Mein Schiff 1 will sail to Hamburg from Turku to be christened there on the 11th of May. She will begin operation shortly after. “The impressive new 50m wide steel and glass window structure that makes up the new Diamond at the aft of the ship just above the propellers is a good example how we combine architectural design with our engineering skills supported by sophisticated computer models. Innovations, strengthening our Turku team and our 200million Euro investments in Finland well in advance are our way to compete with our mostly government owned and supported competitors”, said Jan Meyer, the CEO of Meyer Turku. Environmental friendliness was also in focus in the design of New Mein Schiff 1. Each Mein Schiff marks another step in energy efficiency improvement and with New Mein Schiff 1 Meyer Turku is making another big step ahead by engineering it for a 10% energy efficiency improvement compared to last year’s Mein Schiff 6. Mein Schiff 1 is one of the first cruise ships to be equipped with catalytic converters for the main and auxiliary engines, reducing nitrogen oxide emissions. “I am very thankful to our customer TUI cruises to embark and engage in this innovation journey with us and continue it with the recently ordered Mein Schiff 7”, the CEO said. “On our tenth anniversary, we are giving ourselves and our guests the gift of a new Mein Schiff 1, which marks the starting point for a new generation of ships.

       " 'The Finnish economic growth is set to keep its strong path this and next year, but the upward trend will be at a standstill after a couple of years, said Nordea Bank on Tuesday. The Finnish economy will grow by 3 percent in 2018 and 2.5 percent in 2019, said Nordea, adding that household consumption will take over the role of key growth engine from exports and investment, thanks to positive labor market developments. However, the bank warned that the growth will start to deteriorate at the turn of the decade. One of the major reasons is that the improved competitiveness in recent years can turn even to a deteriorating track, according to Aki Kangasharju, chief economist at Nordea Bank. The earnings level will rise this and next year by 2 percent. At the same time, the euro will remain strong in the near future. \"During the economic cycle, Finland\\'s productivity growth will be fast, but now, with the improvement of employment, it has faded again. It is difficult to imagine that the productivity growth will accelerate to over one percent over the next a few years,\" said Kangasharju. The worsening labor shortage and the decline of exports are also risk factors to the Finnish economic growth. Furthermore, the economy is vulnerable to a significant escalation of trade tensions, and even an increase in uncertainty may be enough to cut international investment growth, which would mean slower export growth for Finland, noted Nordea. Following three consecutive years of negative growth, the Finnish economy finally started to show some signs of recovery in 2015. Since 2016, the economy has grown gradually and achieved a bullish growth by 3.2 percent in 2017.',\n",

Sales were up 3% compared to last year and slightly lower than analysts had expected, but numbers beat the gloomiest forecasts and were enough to deliver Apple its best second quarter ever, with revenues of over $61bn. That beat the record of $58bn set in 2015. Apple poised to move further into media amid Wall Street 'panic' Read more\\n\\n“We’re thrilled to report our best March quarter ever, with strong revenue growth in iPhone, services and wearables,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive officer. “We are very bullish on Apple’s future,” Cook told analysts after the news broke. Apple sold 9.11m iPads and 4.08m Macs over the quarter. Analysts had worried that the high-priced iPhone X would dent sales. The results came after Apple suppliers including AMS and Taiwan Semiconductors have reported slowing revenues in a sign seen by analysts as proof of shaky demand for iPhone X. The company announced it would be adding $100bn to its stock buyback programme, plus a 16% increase in its quarterly dividend. Taking advantage of the Trump administration’s new tax laws, Apple is in the process of repatriating the majority of the $252bn in profits it currently holds overseas. The buyback helped Apple’s shares rise over 5% in after-hours trading. The company’s stock has risen by about 80% in the past two years, setting it on course to battle Amazon to become the first company to be valued at $1tn. But Apple’s share price has stumbled recently as fears about slowing iPhone sales took their toll. The iPhone remains Apple’s biggest product, even as sales of services and other items, including the Apple Watch, have grown. Services – from the Apple Store, iCloud, Apple Pay and others – generated $9bn over the quarter. But the 11-year-old mobile device accounts for the majority Apple’s revenues and contributed $100bn over the quarter. Despite the better-than-expected results, however, sales are slowing. Apple threatens leakers with criminal action in leaked memo – report Read more. Thomas Husson, principal analyst at Forrester, said the results did not mean innovation in the high-end smartphone is dead. Husson said: “However, it indicates Apple will have to smartly manage its iPhone product portfolio and pricing, especially in Asia, where some countries still witness smartphone growth Apple has proven over the past few years that it masters the art and science of managing its product portfolio.”\\n\\nYet Husson believes 2018 represents a tipping point for Apple. “It has no choice but to demonstrate it can reduce its dependency on iPhone sales and enter new adjacent markets and territories,” he said. “Because it’s a human-centered and ideas-driven marketing company, Apple is still the most valuable brand worldwide and it would be a mistake to make too early a call based on this quarterly financial earnings.”\\n\\nOn a call with analysts Cook was once again critical of tech rivals, including Facebook, that have been rocked by privacy scandals. “We believe privacy is a fundamental human right,” he said.\",\n",
       " 'Herbert Diess, the new chief executive officer (CEO) of Volkswagen, announced on Friday that he will speed up an ongoing process of far-reaching corporate reform at the German carmaker. During his first speech as CEO, Diess told press that his goal was the \"continued development\" of the Wolfsburg-based automotive giant. He emphasized that he is not about to start a \"revolution\" but instead hereby hope to build on initiatives already launched under his predecessor Matthias Mueller. \"Our aim is to make Volkswagen an industry leader with regards to profitability, innovation and sustainability,\" Diess said. In the future, management would be able to make decisions more quickly, not least thanks to a new division of labor in the corporation. Diess took the reins of Volkswagen following an emergency supervisory board meeting which was convened in reaction to wild media speculation over a looming personnel shake-up. The 60-year-old Austrian was formerly the director of the company flagship brand Volkswagen. Speaking on Friday, Diess praised his predecessor Mueller for successfully steering Volkswagen through the \"dieselgate\" scandal. \"Volkswagen is in a more robust operative and strategic position than ever,\" board chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch seconded. The appointment of Diess as CEO coincides with the most significant corporate restructuring in Volkswagen\\'s history. The company confirmed on Friday that, moving forward, the group will be divided into six independent units, with all China-related business being led as a division of its own. A \"volume group\" will combine the mass-appeal brands Volkswagen, Skoda and Seat, alongside a \"super-premium group\" including Porsche, Bugatti, Bentley and Lamborghini, and a \"premium group\" constituted by Audi. Additionally, a \"commercial utility holding\" encompassing truck and bus production (MAN, Scania) will be created and prepared for an initial public offering (IPO). Diess will simultaneously act as corporate CEO, head of research & development, and head of the volume group, but will receive assistance from a yet-to-be-appointed operative manager to deal with day-to-day demands. Acting Audi chief Rupert Stadler will assume responsibility for the premium group and global sales, while Porsche director Oliver Blume directs the super premium group as well as general production. The influential board member and head of the Volkswagen workers\\' council Bernd Osterloh noted in a letter to staff that the executive personnel reshuffle had the \"full support\" of labor representatives.',\n",

According to a statement, IAG, which includes Spain\\'s Iberia and Vueling, Britain\\'s British Airways and Ireland\\'s Aer Lingus, considers that Norwegian is an attractive investment and plans to make a full offer. This initial investment is \"intended to establish a position from which to initiate discussions with Norwegian, including the possibility of a full offer,\" IAG said, although these discussions have not taken place yet. The group explained that it is simply a strategic operation and that at the moment, no decision has been taken regarding the final purchase. Following this announcement, Norwegian shares rose by more than 20 percent on the stock exchange, local media reported. \"IAG confirms that no such discussions have taken place to date, that it has taken no decision to make an offer at this time and that there is no certainty that any such decision will be made,\" the aeronautical holding company said. Norwegian, meanwhile, stressed that they had no knowledge about the operation before it was announced this morning. However, they said that the IAG movement confirms \"the sustainability and potential of our business model and global growth\". The Scandinavian airline has seen significant growth in Spain due to its policy of long-range flights at low prices. According to data from the Spanish Airports and Air Navigation (AENA), Norwegian was the eighth most used airline in the first quarter of 2018, growing by 6.6 percent when compared with the same period of last year. The company launched an ambitious strategy of long-range flights at low prices with weekly departures to some U.S. destinations: Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Miami. However, this strategy of expansion meant losses of 30 million euros (36.9 million U.S. dollars) last year, according to the Spanish press.',\n",
       " 'US telecoms giant T-Mobile has agreed to buy its rival Sprint in a $26bn (£18.9bn) deal. The merger of America\\'s third and fourth largest mobile carriers is designed to create a more competitive firm with about 130 million customers. However, the deal is expected to attract regulatory scrutiny over its potential impact on customer prices. T-Mobile boss John Legere said the new firm would spend $40bn on building a 5G mobile network in the next three years. \"Together, we will build the highest-capacity mobile network in US history!! I\\'m talking 30X more capacity than T-Mobile today!!\" he said in one of a series of Tweets. It comes after months of negotiations between T-Mobile\\'s controlling shareholder, Deutsche Telekom, and Japan\\'s SoftBank, which controls Sprint. Under the deal, Deutsche Telekom will own 42% of the combined company and control its board. Softbank will hold a 27% stake. Mr Legere will lead the new firm which will take the T-Mobile name and have a market value of $146bn. Analysts say the combined company will have more clout to compete with the first and second biggest US telecoms firms, Verizon and AT&T, each of which have more than 100 million subscribers. In particular, they say it will be better positioned in the race to provide America with next generation 5G mobile broadband technology. They also believe that, without T-Mobile, Sprint lacks the scale needed to upgrade its network. Competition concerns. Sprint and T-Mobile had been in talks about a potential tie-up since 2014, when the Obama administration scuppered a previous merger attempt over competition concerns. Under the Trump administration, regulators have continued to challenge deals they believe could push up prices and are likely to scrutinise this latest takeover closely. It has also allegedly opened a probe into claims of co-ordination by AT&T, Verizon and a telecoms standards body to hinder consumers from easily switching provider, Reuters reported earlier in April. In a statement, Mr Legere said the merger between Sprint and T-Mobile would lower prices and help the US accelerate its development of 5G, amid fierce competition from China. He also said it would create tens of thousands of jobs in rural America - factors analysts say could help sway officials in the Trump administration. \"This combination will create a fierce competitor with the network scale to deliver more for consumers and businesses in the form of lower prices, more innovation, and a second-to-none network experience - and do it all so much faster than either company could on its own,\" Mr Legere said.',\n",
       " 'Sainsbury\\'s has confirmed plans to merge with Asda, which is currently owned by US supermarket giant Walmart. The supermarkets said that grocery prices would fall in both chains as a result of the merger. Sainsbury\\'s chief executive Mike Coupe also said the deal would not lead to store closures or job losses in stores. The combination of the UK\\'s second and third largest supermarkets would create a giant, representing nearly £1 in every £3 spent on groceries. Mr Coupe - who will lead the new combined group - said he believed the two supermarkets were \"the best possible fit\". Shares in Sainsbury\\'s jumped 15% in response to the merger news. Walmart, which has owned Asda since 1999, will retain 42% of the combined business. What will the merger mean for shoppers? The supermarkets say that as a result of the merger, they expect to be able to lower prices \"by around 10% on many of the products customers buy regularly\". Sainsbury\\'s and Asda will remain separate brands and no stores will close, Mr Coupe told the BBC. \"There\\'s been a bit of commentary over the weekend where people have been alluding to the fact that the only way of making this happen is by closing stores - that is not true,\" said Mr Coupe. Following the merger Argos will open outlets within Asda stores, the firms said. Sainsbury\\'s took over Argos in 2016 and has been integrating the catalogue retailer into its own stores. Sainsbury\\'s said it couldn\\'t comment on what would happen to customers\\' Nectar points after the merger. What will it mean for suppliers? The combined business will overtake current market leader Tesco, representing around 30% of UK grocery sales. That will give it greater muscle in the market. Labour\\'s shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told the BBC she was concerned at the impact on suppliers of the proposed tie-up. The combined group \"will have immense purchasing power, giving them an opportunity to bargain very hard with suppliers,\" she warned. Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the firms should explain how they plan to merge their supply chains fairly, and reassure people that cost savings wouldn\\'t be achieved \"simply by milking their small suppliers for all they\\'re worth\". Sainsbury\\'s and Asda executives said one advantage of the merger would be the opportunity to bring in \"the power of Walmart in the form of buying of general merchandise and in the form of their systems and investments\". Will the merger be allowed? A competition probe seems inevitable given the size of the two chains and the UK\\'s competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), said on Monday it was \"likely\" to review the merger. Sainsbury\\'s and Asda have asked for the CMA investigation to be fast-tracked and hope to complete the deal by the autumn of 2019. At the weekend, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the merger risked creating \"even more concentrated local monopolies\" and said the CMA should force the companies to sell off stores if the new giant was dominant in a particular area. Retail analyst Nick Bubb said he thought there was \"a pretty good chance\" that the deal will be allowed to proceed, but the main debate would be over how many stores Sainsbury\\'s and Asda would have to sell \"to placate the CMA\". \"Too many store disposals and the deal won\\'t be worth doing... too few store disposals and the CMA will look toothless… hopefully there will be a \"Goldilocks\" scenario for Sainsbury\\'s/Asda.\" Why are the two chains combining? Sainsbury\\'s and Asda are both being buffeted by competition from budget supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl. On the horizon, Amazon is making initial steps into grocery deliveries. \"I think from a market share perspective, both Sainsbury\\'s and Asda are landlocked to a certain extent. They\\'re not really able to grow at a rapid rate,\" said Steve Dresser, director of the Grocery Insight consultancy. \"If they remain on their own it\\'s difficult to see how they get any real growth beyond standard organic growth, which isn\\'t necessarily going to be enough when Amazon joins the market,\" said Mr Dresser. The two chains are in many ways complementary: Sainsbury\\'s stores are focused more in the south of the UK and target a higher-end market segment. Asda is more concentrated in the north, offering lower-cost groceries. Even after reducing prices for customers, Mike Coupe thinks synergies will generate £500m of extra savings, in part through taking advantage of Walmart\\'s clout with suppliers. As for Walmart they will receive £3bn as well as their 42% stake in the company. But the deal also offers Walmart the option of exiting the UK market altogether in four years\\' time.',\n",

International demand, including in the UK and Germany, helped to drive the growth, the fast food chain said.

The UK is one of the strongest markets for McDonald\\'s, reporting 12 years of consistent quarterly growth. But the firm could face negative publicity in the UK this week as a second wave of strikes hits some of its restaurants.

They are demanding a minimum salary of £10 per hour, an end to lower \"youth rates\" of pay and greater flexibility in working hours. While the number is small, the first ever McDonald\\'s UK strikes in September involved a similar number of workers and attracted widespread media attention.

The US said the firm\\'s in-flight entertainment division hired consultants for \"improper\" purposes and concealed payments to sales agents in China and elsewhere in Asia. The US said the acts violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Panasonic did not respond to a request for comment. The payments were made by US-based subsidiary, Panasonic Avionics Corp, between 2007 and 2016, the US said. In one case, the firm hired a foreign official as a consultant at the same time that the official was negotiating a contract between Panasonic and a government-owned airline in the Middle East. The official was paid $875,000 over a six-year period, despite doing \"little work\", according to US documents. In other cases, Panasonic determined that sales agents in China and elsewhere did not pass anti-bribery certification, but executives \"secretly\" rehired them as subcontractors, the US said. Through that process, the employees shielded more than $7m in payments to at least 13 people, the US said. The US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) said Panasonic also overstated profits in one quarter in 2012 by backdating an agreement with an airline.

Former chief financial officer Sushovan Hussain was found guilty of artificially inflating the firm\\'s financial position before it was sold. Mr Hussain\\'s lawyers say he will appeal against the judgement. Prosecutors argued that starting in 2009, senior managers at Autonomy, which was one of the UK\\'s largest software companies, sought to inflate the company\\'s share price and make the firm more attractive to potential buyers by artificially boosting the number of transactions on its balance sheet. After HP bought Autonomy for £7.1bn in 2011, the US tech giant said it had uncovered accounting irregularities. A year later, it was forced to write off most of the value of the software firm. Autonomy\\'s founder and chief executive, Mike Lynch, a former Cambridge researcher, vehemently rejected HP\\'s claims that management misled HP over the company\\'s value. He said HP had concocted the accusations to distract from their own mismanagement and poor performance.

The carmaker builds its Qashqai and Juke models at the north-eastern England site, where it employs 7,000 people. As well as a fall in the demand for its diesel cars, the job losses relate to a switch in production to newer models. The job cuts follow those at Jaguar Land Rover, which last week said it would shed 1,000 contract staff. A Nissan spokesman said: \"As previously communicated, we are transitioning to a new range of powertrains over the next year. \"As we make the operational changes required to support this, we will be managing a planned short-term reduction in powertrain supply and plant volumes at NMUK in line with our 2018 Business Plan.

Andy Barratt said consumers were buying fewer diesel cars, fearing they were polluting and will face new taxes. However, he claimed new diesels were \"every bit as clean\" as petrol cars. Government and industry must do more to reassure consumers, Mr Barratt warned, given there had already been job cuts as diesel sales slide. Diesel is vital to the UK industry as it makes almost a million diesel engines a year, most of which are exported. \"There has been a lot of chaos in the signalling and in the messaging around diesel and there have been job losses,\" Mr Barratt said. \"The poor motorist just doesn\\'t know what to do - we need to clarify where diesel works and where it doesn\\'t.\" Are diesels cars always the biggest health hazard? Diesel cars: Your questions answered. While some diesel engines produce fewer CO2 emissions than their petrol equivalents, many experts say petrol remains the cleaner option. Diesel cars emit nitrogen oxide, a significant contributor to pollution in cities that can cause respiratory diseases. Diesel car sales fell by 37% this March compared with last year, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) and further falls are forecast for 2018. Consumer confidence has been hit as politicians became more focused on air quality, and potential customers are worried about new regulations and taxes. Mr Barratt said the car industry needed to \"step up\" and offer a clearer message to reassure drivers, but that the government should do more as well. \"Fortunately our Dagenham plant has increased production based around exports and the demand for commercial vehicles that we have,\" he said. \"But there is no doubt there is a real crisis of confidence among consumers.\" In December, the SMMT said falling business and consumer confidence was \"being exacerbated by ongoing anti-diesel messages from government\". \"Diesel remains the right choice for many drivers, not least because of its fuel economy and lower CO2 emissions,\" boss Mike Hawes said. This month both Jaguar Land Rover and Nissan have announced job cuts at UK plants because of falling diesel sales.',\n",
       " 'Companies that supply products to Sainsbury\\'s and Asda fear they could suffer when the two grocery chains merge. Sainsbury\\'s boss Mike Coupe has pledged to cut prices on everyday products by around 10% after the deal. But suppliers fear they will have to shoulder the cost of those savings. \"There will be plenty of losers from this,\" said Austin Sugarman, boss of Fine Foods International, a supplier of instant coffee based in Bedfordshire. \"If suppliers are going to have to come up with the savings, then we\\'ll see consolidation in the supply base,\" he told the BBC. Mr Coupe said the combined group\\'s buying power would enable it to strike better deals with suppliers, and these savings would then be passed on to consumers. But industry bodies fear this will make life very difficult for smaller suppliers, who are already having to adapt to higher costs from auto-enrolment pensions and the Living Wage, as well as the weaker pound since the Brexit vote. \"We already operate in a very competitive retail environment,\" said Gordon Polson, director of the Federation of Bakers. \"We just don\\'t see possibly how our products could be reduced any further.\" Ian Cass, managing director of the Forum of Private Business agreed: \"If suppliers are asked to reduce prices by 10% to stay on the Sainsbury\\'s-Asda supply chain, then some small companies could go out of business.\" Mr Cass was concerned that the combined company - which will be Britain\\'s biggest grocer - could seek to pressure suppliers into unfavourable terms by holding the threat of losing contracts over their heads. He cited Arcadia Group, which owns brands such as Topshop and Dorothy Perkins as an example. In January, the firm imposed a 2% discount on all current and existing orders from suppliers due to poor Christmas sales. On top of all these pressures, suppliers also have to contend with the fact that many retailers in the grocery industry make suppliers wait up to three months for payment. \"Surely there are other efficiencies you could make in partnership with suppliers, other than turning around and demanding a 10% discount,\" Mr Cass said. A better deal? Sentinel Management Consultants acts as an adviser to suppliers on their negotiations with supermarkets. It said that while some suppliers will undoubtedly be \"quaking with fear\" after the Sainsbury\\'s-Asda merger announcement, others will have more power to negotiate with the new firm than they realise. \"Suppliers need to get better at saying no,\" said Sentinel boss David Sables. Mr Sables said small businesses should make sure they understand their rights under the Groceries Supply Code of Practice, and also understand that supermarket chains tend to hold the threat of getting rid of suppliers as a bluff. \"There is a game being played about the demand for cheaper prices, and very often when suppliers have said no and they\\'re walking away, nine times out of 10 that\\'s the price they get the contract to supply at.\" A Sainsbury\\'s spokeswoman told the BBC that suppliers would benefit from the deal. \"At this stage, we are still in the early phases of our plans but we believe this is a great opportunity for suppliers as they will be able to make their supply chains more streamlined, to develop differentiated product ranges and to grow their businesses as we grow ours. \"We are also actively investing in small suppliers - we are recruiting a team which is dedicated to working with smaller and distinctive suppliers to help them bring new products to market and to handhold them through this process.\"',\n",
