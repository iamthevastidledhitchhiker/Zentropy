Could the Bank of England soon pop up among your Spotify playlist followers ? Its chief economist has hinted that analysis of people 's music choices could be a useful tool and give a `` window on their soul '' .
In a speech about new possibilities in data analytics , Andy Haldane said data on downloads from Spotify had been used to gain an insight into people 's mood .
Book lists , TV choices and even computer games could also be used to gauge consumer confidence .
He said : `` To give one recent example , data on music downloads from Spotify has been used , in tandem with semantic search techniques applied to the words of songs , to provide an indicator of people 's sentiment .
'' He said the results did at least as well in tracking consumer spending as the well-regarded Michigan survey of consumer confidence in the US .
Mr Haldane said games such as EVE Online and World of Warcraft were particularly useful as they had primitive economies which allowed goods and money to change hands between players .
He said some economists had in fact begun to use gaming technologies to understand behaviour and could be used to explore behaviour in a virtual economy by studying player reactions to certain changes in policy .
Mr Haldane is known for his attempts to broaden the Bank 's knowledge base .
Last month , he invited left-wing activist and singer songwriter Billy Bragg into the Bank 's Threadneedle Street headquarters to give a talk .
